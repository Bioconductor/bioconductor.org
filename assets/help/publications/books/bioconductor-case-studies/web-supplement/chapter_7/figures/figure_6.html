              Figure 7.6:             </b>Expression values of a probe set that has a highly significant p-value in the unmoderated t-test, but is unremarkable in the moderated test. Note the y-axis scaling: although the two groups look well separated, the absolute difference is small. Most likely, this is a chance artifact. You can verify this by looking at the expression values of this probe set in the other samples that were not used here.
