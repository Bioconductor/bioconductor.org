              Figure 5.8:             </b>Robustness and the ``most genes not differentially expressed'' assumption. The three panels show results of using VSN on an (artificial) dataset with a high fraction of differentially expressed features. Data for 2334 features, shown in violet, have been computationally ``spiked-in'' as if their targets were strongly upregulated. The VSN algorithm was not aware of the distinction between the blue and violet data points. For lts.quantile=1, which corresponds to ordinary nonrobust least sum of squares regression, the fit is heavily affected by the violet outliers. For lts.quantile=0.5, which corresponds to least trimmed sum of squares regression with a trimming quantile q=50, the blue data points are distributed tightly around the M=0 line, and the algorithm has managed to disregard the outliers. The result for lts.quantile=0.8 is in between. Note how the outliers not only affect the estimation of the array scaling factors (k_j in Equation~( eq:vsnmodel )), but also of the background-correction offsets (b_j in Equation~( eq:vsnmodel )). This explains why the difference among the three panels is not just a shift in M-direction, but also a change in the shape of the distributions of the transformed data.
