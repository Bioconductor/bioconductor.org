Bioconductor is an open source, open development software project to
provide tools for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput
genomic data.  It is based primarily on the
[R](http://www.r-project.org) programming language.

The Bioconductor [release version](/packages/release/bioc/) is updated
twice each year, and is appropriate for most users. There is also a
[development version](/packages/devel/bioc), to which new features and
packages are added prior to incorporation in the release. A large
number of [meta-data packages](/packages/release/data/annotation)
provide pathway, organism, microarray and other annotations.

The Bioconductor project started in 2001 and is overseen by a
[core team](/about/core-team/), based primarily at the
[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](http://www.fhcrc.org), and by
other members coming from US and international institutions.

## Bioconductor Packages

Most Bioconductor components are distributed as [R
packages](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#R-Add_002dOn-Packages).
The functional scope of [Bioconductor packages](/packages/release/bioc/)
includes the analysis of DNA microarray, sequence, flow, SNP, and other data.

## Project Goals

The broad goals of the Bioconductor project are:

* To provide widespread access to a broad range of powerful statistical
  and graphical methods for the analysis of genomic data.
* To facilitate the inclusion of biological metadata in the analysis of
  genomic data, e.g. literature data from PubMed, annotation data from
  Entrez genes.
* To provide a common software platform that enables the rapid development
  and deployment of extensible, scalable, and interoperable software.
* To further scientific understanding by producing high-quality
  [documentation](/help/package-vignettes/) and reproducible research.
* To [train](/help/course-materials/) researchers on computational and
  statistical methods for the analysis of genomic data.

## Main Project Features

* **The R Project for Statistical Computing**. Using
  [R](http://www.r-project.org) provides a broad range of advantages
  to the Bioconductor project, including:
  * A high-level interpreted language to easily and quickly prototype
    new computational methods.
  * A well established system for packaging together software with
    documentation.
  * An object-oriented framework for addressing the diversity and
    complexity of computational biology and bioinformatics problems.
  * Access to on-line computational biology and bioinformatics data.
  * Support for rich statistical simulation and modeling activities.
  * Cutting edge data and model visualization capabilities.
  * Active development by a dedicated team of researchers with a
    strong commitment to good documentation and software design.

* **Documentation and reproducible research**. Each [Bioconductor
  package](/packages/release/bioc/) contains one or more
  [vignettes](/help/package-vignettes/), documents that provide a
  textual, task-oriented description of the package's functionality.
  Vignettes come in several forms. Many are "HowTo"s that demonstrate
  how a particular task can be accomplished with that package's software.
  Others provide a more thorough overview of the package or discuss general
  issues related to the package.

* **Statistical and graphical methods**. The Bioconductor project
  provides access to powerful statistical and graphical methods for
  the analysis of genomic data.  [Analysis packages](/packages/release/bioc/)
  address [workflows](/help/workflows) for analysis of oligonucleotide
  arrays, sequence analysis, flow cytometry. and other
  high-throughput genomic data.  The [R package
  system](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#R-Add_002dOn-Packages)
  itself provides implementations for a broad range of
  state-of-the-art statistical and graphical techniques, including
  linear and non-linear modeling, cluster analysis, prediction,
  resampling, survival analysis, and time-series analysis.

* **Annotation**. The Bioconductor project provides software for
  associating microarray and other genomic data in real time with
  biological metadata from web databases such as GenBank, Entrez genes
  and PubMed ([annotate](/packages/release/bioc/html/annotate.html)
  package).  Functions are also provided for incorporating the results
  of statistical analysis in HTML reports with links to annotation web
  resources.  Software tools are available for assembling and
  processing genomic annotation data, from databases such as GenBank,
  the Gene Ontology Consortium, Entrez genes, UniGene, the UCSC Human
  Genome Project
  ([AnnotationDbi](/packages/release/bioc/html/AnnotationDbi.html)
  package).  [Annotation data packages](/packages/release/data/annotation/)
  are distributed to provide mappings between different probe
  identifiers (e.g. Affy IDs, Entrez genes, PubMed). Customized
  annotation libraries can also be assembled.

* **Bioconductor short courses**. The Bioconductor project has developed a
  program of [short courses](/help/course-materials/) on software and
  statistical methods for the analysis of genomic data. Courses have been
  given for audiences with backgrounds in either biology or statistics. All
  [course materials](/help/course-materials/) (lectures and computer labs)
  are available on this site.

* **Open source**. The Bioconductor project has a commitment to full
  open source discipline, with distribution via a public subversion
  (version control) server. All contributions exist under an open
  source license such as Artistic 2.0, GPL2, or BSD. There are many
  different reasons why open source software is beneficial to the
  analysis of microarray data and to computational biology in
  general. The reasons include:
  * To provide full access to algorithms and their implementation
  * To facilitate software improvements through bug fixing and software
    extension
  * To encourage good scientific computing and statistical practice by
    providing appropriate tools and instruction
  * To provide a workbench of tools that allow researchers to explore and
    expand the methods used to analyze biological data
  * To ensure that the international scientific community is the owner of
    the software tools needed to carry out research
  * To lead and encourage commercial support and development of those tools
    that are successful
  * To promote reproducible research by providing open and accessible tools
    with which to carry out that research (reproducible research is distinct
    from independent verification)

* **Open development**. Users are encouraged to become developers, either
  by contributing
  [Bioconductor compliant packages](/developers/package-guidelines/)
  or documentation. Additionally Bioconductor provides a mechanism for
  linking together different groups with common goals to foster
  collaboration on software, often at the level of shared development.
