About Bioconductor
==================

Bioconductor is an open source and open development software project
to provide tools for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data.

Bioconductor is based primarily on the R programming language, but
does contain contributions in other programming languages. It has two
releases each year that follow the semiannual releases of R. At any
one time there is a release version, which corresponds to the released
version of R, and a development version, which corresponds to the
development version of R. Most users will find the release version
appropriate for their needs. In addition there are a large number of
meta-data packages available that are mainly, but not solely, oriented
towards different types of microarrays.

The Bioconductor project was started in the Fall of 2001 and is
overseen by the [Bioconductor core team](/about/core-team/), based
primarily at the [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center](http://fhcrc.org) with other members coming from various US
and international institutions. It gained widespread exposure in the
groundbreaking Genome Biology 2004 paper Bioconductor: open software
development for computational biology and bioinformatics. More project
details are available online in the Bioconductor annual reports.

Bioconductor Packages
---------------------

Most Bioconductor components are distributed as R packages, which are
add-on modules for R. Initially most of the Bioconductor software
packages focused primarily on DNA microarray data analysis. As the
project has matured, the functional scope of the software packages
broadened to include the analysis of all types of genomic data, such
as SAGE, sequence, or SNP data.
