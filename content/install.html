    The <strong>install()</strong> function (in the BiocManager package) has
    arguments that change its default behavior; type ?install for further help.

  <h3 id="find-bioconductor-packages">Find Bioconductor Packages</h3>

  <p>Visit the <a>software package list</a> to discover available packages.</p>
  <p>
    To search through available packages programmatically, use the following:
  </p>

  <pre>
<code class="dark nohighlight">
BiocManager::available()
</code>
</pre>

  <p>
    For example, using a “^org” search pattern will show all of the available
    organism annotation packages.

  <h3 id="update-bioconductor-packages">
    Update Installed Bioconductor Packages
  </h3>

  <p>
    Bioconductor packages, especially those in the development branch, are
    updated fairly regularly. To identify packages requiring update within your
    version of Bioconductor, start a new session of R and enter:
  </p>

  <pre>
<code class="dark nohighlight">
BiocManager::install()
</code>
</pre>

  <p>
    Use the argument <strong>ask=FALSE</strong> to update old packages without
    being prompted. Read the help page for ?install for additional details.
  </p>

  <h5>Updgrading Installed Bioconductor Packages</h5>

  <p>
    Due to the development cycle, all versions of R will eventually support more
    than one version of Bioconductor. To use the latest version of Bioconductor
    for your version of R, enter:
  </p>

  <pre>
<code class="dark nohighlight">
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install()
</code>
</pre>

  <p>
    Remember that more recent versions of Bioconductor may be available if your
    version of R is out-of-date. BiocManager will notify you when your version
    of R is out-of-date.
  </p>

  <p>
    For more details on Bioconductor approaches to versioning, see the
    <a
      href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BiocManager/vignettes/BiocManager.html#managing-multiple-versions"
      >advanced section</a
    >
    in the vignette and version numbering in the
    <a href="https://contributions.bioconductor.org/versionnum.html"
      >developer reference</a
    >
    section.

  <h5>Recompiling Installed Bioconductor Packages</h5>

  <p>
    Rarely, underlying changes in the operating system require ALL installed
    packages to be recompiled for source (C or Fortran) compatibility. One way
    to address this might be to start a new R session and enter:
  </p>

  <pre>
<code class="dark nohighlight">
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
pkgs <- rownames(installed.packages())
BiocManager::install(pkgs, type = "source", checkBuilt = TRUE)
</code>
</pre>

  <p>
    As this will reinstall all currently installed packages, it likely involves
    a significant amount of network bandwidth and compilation time. All packages
    are implicitly updated, and the cumulative effect might introduce wrinkles
    that disrupt your work flow. It also requires that you have the necessary
    compilers installed.
  </p>

  <h3 id="troubleshoot-bioconductor-packages">
    Troubleshoot Package Installations
  </h3>

  <p>Use the commands:</p>

  <pre>
<code class="dark nohighlight">
BiocManager::valid()     ## R version 3.5 or later
</code>
</pre>

  <p>
    to flag packages that are either out-of-date or too new for your version of
    Bioconductor. The output suggests ways to solve identified problems, and the
    help page <strong>?valid</strong> lists arguments influencing the behavior
    of the function.
  </p>

  <h5>Troubleshoot BiocManager</h5>

  <p>
    One likely reason for BiocManager not working on your system could be that
    your version of R is too old for <stronger>BiocManager</stronger>. In order
    avoid this issue, please ensure that you have the latest version of R
    installed in your system. BiocManager supports R versions from 3.5.0 and
    above.
  </p>

  <h3 id="why-biocmanagerinstall">Why use BiocManager::install()?</h3>

  <p>
    <strong>BiocManager::install()</strong> is the recommended way to install
    Bioconductor packages. There are several reasons for preferring this to the
    ‘standard’ way in which R pacakges are installed via
    <strong>install.packages()</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bioconductor has a repository and release schedule that differs from R
    (Bioconductor has a ‘devel’ branch to which new packages and updates are
    introduced, and a stable ‘release’ branch emitted once every 6 months to
    which bug fixes but not new features are introduced).
  </p>

  <p>
    A consequence of the mismatch between R and Bioconductor release schedules
    is that the Bioconductor version identified by
    <strong>install.packages()</strong> is sometimes not the most recent
    ‘release’ available. For instance, an R minor version may be introduced some
    months before the next Bioc release. After the Bioc release the users of the
    R minor version will be pointed to an out-of-date version of Bioconductor.
  </p>

  <p>
    A consequence of the distinct ‘devel’ branch is that
    <strong>install.packages()</strong>
    sometimes points only to the ‘release’ repository, whereas Bioconductor
    developers and users wanting leading-edge features wish to access the
    Bioconductor ‘devel’ repository. For instance, the Bioconductor 3.0 release
    is available for R.3.1.x, so Bioconductor developers and leading-edge users
    need to be able to install the devel version of Bioconductor packages into
    the same version (though perhaps different instance or at least library
    location) of R that supports version 2.14 of Bioconductor.
  </p>

  <p>
    An indirect consequence of Bioconductor’s structured release is that
    packages generally have more extensive dependencies with one another, both
    explicitly via the usual package mechanisms and implicitly because the
    repository, release structure, and Bioconductor community interactions favor
    re-use of data representations and analysis concepts across packages. There
    is thus a higher premium on knowing that packages are from the same release,
    and that all packages are current within the release.
  </p>

  <p>
    The BiocManager package serves as the primary way to ensure that the
    appropriate Bioconductor installation is used with respect to the version of
    R in use regardless of the R and Bioconductor release cycles.
  </p>

  <pre>
<code class="dark nohighlight">
> library(BiocManager)
Bioconductor version 3.9 (BiocManager 1.30.4), ?BiocManager::install
for help
</code>
</pre>

  <p>
    The <strong>install()</strong> function is provided by BiocManager. This is
    a wrapper around install.packages, but with the repository chosen according
    to the version of Bioconductor in use, rather than to the version relevant
    at the time of the release of R.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>install()</strong> also nudges users to remain current within a
    release, by default checking for out-of-date packages and asking if the user
    would like to update.

    (at some points in the R / Bioconductor release cycle use of ‘devel’
    requires use of a different version of R itself, in which case the attempt
    to install devel fails with an appropriate message).
  </p>

  <p>
    The BiocManager package also provides <strong>valid()</strong> to test that
    the installed packages are not a hodgepodge from different Bioconductor
    releases (the ‘too new’ packages have been installed from source rather than
    a repository; regular users would seldom have these).

  <p>
    For users who spend a lot of time in Bioconductor, the features outlined
    above become increasingly important and <strong>install()</strong> is much
    preferred to <strong>install.packages()</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>Pre-configured Bioconductor</h3>

  <p>
    Bioconductor is also available as
    <a href="/help/docker/">Docker images</a> or available for use in the
    <a href="https://anvil.bioconductor.org/">AnVIL</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Legacy and Older R Versions</h3>

  <p>
    is always recommended to update to the most current version of R and
    Bioconductor. If this is not possible and <strong>R < 3.5.0</strong> ,
    please use the following for installing Bioconductor packages.
  </p>

  <p>To install core packages, type the following in an R command window:</p>

  <pre>
<code class="dark nohighlight">
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
</code>
</pre>

  <p>
    Install specific packages, e.g., “GenomicFeatures” and “AnnotationDbi”,
    with:
  </p>

  <pre>
<code class="dark nohighlight">
BiocInstaller::biocLite(c("GenomicFeatures", "AnnotationDbi"))
</code>
