    Bioconductor is an open source and open development software
    project to provide tools for the analysis and comprehension of
    genomic data.  Bioconductor is based primarily on the R
    programming language, but does contain contributions in other
    programming languages. It has two releases each year that follow
    the semiannual releases of R.  Put an intro welcome paragraph here
