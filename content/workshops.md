However, you may not include these in separately published works

course materials (slides, vignettes, scripts) we would appreciate it if
you would cite the authors and refer your audience to the Bioconductor
website.

The Bioconductor project can provide customized workshops on
statistical methods and software for the analysis of genomic data for
different educational and industrial clients. Interested parties should
