<h1>A Brand New nanoc Site</h1>

<p>You’ve just created a new nanoc site. The page you are looking at right now is the home page for your site (and it’s probably the only page).</p>

<p>To get started, consider replacing this default homepage with your own customized homepage. Some pointers on how to do so:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Change this page’s content</strong> by editing “content.html” file in the “content” directory. This is the actual page content, and therefore doesn’t include the header, sidebar or style information (those are part of the layout).</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Change the layout</strong>, which is the “default.txt” file in the “layouts/default” directory, and create something unique (and hopefully less bland).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you need any help with customizing your nanoc web site, be sure to check out the documentation (see sidebar), and be sure to subscribe to the discussion group (also see sidebar). Enjoy!</p>

    I'm pure CSS3 for maximum simplicity and speed in Firefox and Safari,
    but I still look good in IE7 and above!
    Thanks to the magic of conditional CSS and a small bit of
    extra markup, it all comes together.
    In IE6, I look square, but IE6 users, a dwindling breed, are used to ugliness.
