  The course aims to give Ph.D.-students in statistics as well as other Ph.D.-students a good introduction to microarray data analysis using R and Bioconductor. This is achieved by inviting some of the leading researchers in statistical analysis of microarray data and developers of R-packages to give the main lectures and combine this with hands-on computer exercises.
