## The Bioconductor teaching committee

The Bioconductor teaching committee is a collaborative effort to 
consolidate Bioconductor-focused training material and establish 
a community of Bioconductor trainers. We define a curriculum and 
implement online lessons for beginner and more advanced R users 
who want to learn to analyse their data with Bioconductor packages.

The Bioconductor teaching committee reports to the Bioconductor 
[Community Advisory Board](http://bioconductor.org/about/community-advisory-board/). 
It is currently chaired by Charlotte Soneson and Laurent Gatto. 
Membership is open to everybody interested in contributing and 
joining the discussion during the monthly meetings (announced on 
the Google group, see below).

This meta-repository is used for general discussions. The respective
lessons are developed as modules in their own repositories.

## Modules

- [bioc-intro](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/bioc-intro)
  The **Data science** lesson is based on the [Carpentries Ecology
  Curriculum](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#ecology-workshop). There
  are no pre-requisites for this module, and the materials assume no
  prior knowledge about R and Bioconductor. It introduces R, RStudio,
  teaches data cleaning, management, analysis, and visualisation and
  introduces some Bioconductor concepts. Notes are collated in 
  `bioc-intro.md` in this repo.

- [bioc-project](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/bioc-project)
  The **Bioconductor project** lesson provides an introduction to the
  Bioconductor project such as the Bioconductor home page, packages,
  package landing pages, and package vignettes, where to find help,
  Bioconductor workflows, Bioconductor release schedule and versions,
  some core infrastructure, ... It is meant to be use in combination
  with other modules as part of a wider workshop.

- [bioc-rnaseq](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/bioc-rnaseq)
  **Analysis and interpretation of bulk RNA-Sequencing data using
  Bioconductor** shows how to use Bioconductor packages to analyse
  RNA-Seq data. It expects good familiarity with R and the
  Bioconductor project.
