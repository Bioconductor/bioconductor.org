<p>Bioconductor provides training in computational and statistical
   methods for the analysis of genomic data. You are welcome to use
   material from previous courses. However, you may not include these
   in separately published works (articles, books, websites). When
   using all or parts of the Bioconductor course materials (slides,
   vignettes, scripts) please cite the authors and refer your audience
