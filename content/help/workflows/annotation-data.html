            <h2>Key software packages:</h2>

            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/AnnotationDbi.html">
              AnnotationDbi</a> - Almost all annotations require
              the AnnotationDbi package. This package will be
              automatically installed for you if you install
              another annotation package using biocLite(). It
              contains the code to allow annotation mapping objects
              to be made and manipulated as well as code to
              generate custom chip platforms.</li>

              <li><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Category.html">
              Category</a> - This is the base level package for
              dealing with annotation questions that involve
              categorical data.</li>

              <li><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GOstats.html">
              GOstats</a> - This builds on what is found in
              Category so that you can do hypergeometric testing
              using the Gene Ontology found in the GO.db
              package.</li>

              <li><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/annotate.html">
              annotate</a> - This package contains many helpful
              tools for making use of annotations.</li>

              <li><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/biomaRt.html">
              biomaRt</a> - This package is a great way to pull
              annotation data directly from web based annotation
              resources. Such data is extremely "current", so it is
              a good idea to save and locally manage the data that
              you pull down from biomaRt so that your code will be
              reproducible.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Types of Annotation packages:</h2>

            <ul>
              <li>Organism annotation packages contain all the gene
              data for an entire organism. All Organism packages
              are named like this: org."Xx"."yy".db. Where "Xx" is
              the abbreviation for Genus and species. And "yy" is
              the source of the central ID that is used to tie all
              the data together. Some examples are: <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/org.Hs.eg.db.html">
              org.Hs.eg.db</a> which is for Homo sapiens and is
              based upon Entrez Gene IDs. And <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/org.At.tair.db.html">
              org.At.tair.db</a> which is for Arabidopsis thaliana
              and is based on the tair IDs.</li>

              <li>There are also packages for questions about
              general systems biology data. Some examples of this
              are: <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/KEGG.db.html">
              KEGG.db</a> for accessing data that pertains to Kyoto
              Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/GO.db.html">
              GO.db for</a> accessing data that pertains to the
              Gene Ontology. <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/PFAM.db.html">
              PFAM.db</a> for accessing data that pertains to
              different protein family identifiers and how they
              relate to each other.</li>

              <li>Chip Annotation packages are for accessing only
              the data from one specific platform at a time. These
              packages are named like this: "platformName".db.
              Where "platformName" is the name of the chip platform
              that these packages refer to. And example would be
              <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/hgu95av2.db.html">
              hgu95av2.db</a> which is for the hgu95av2 platform
              from Affymetrix.</li>

              <li>Inparanoid homology packages are for accessing
              inparanoid data. hom."Xx".inp.db Where "Xx" is the
              abbreviation for Genus and species. An example is
              <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/hom.Hs.inp.db.html">
              hom.Hs.inp.db</a> which contains inparanoid based
              mapping data between genes for Homo sapiens and 35
              other organisms.</li>

              <li>.db0 packages are for making custom platform
              specific packages. These packages are named like
              this: "name".db0. Where "name" is the name of the
              organism being represented. A list of the available
              .db0 packages can be obtained by calling
              available.db0Pkgs(). There is one of these for each
              supported organism. An example would be <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/Human.db0.html">
              human.db0</a>. Users should not need these installed
              unless they plan to make custom chip packages
              according the guidelines in the SQLForge vignette
              that is included with the AnnotationDbi package.
              These packages must be upgraded before you attempt to
              update your custom chip packages as they contain the
              source databases needed by the SQLForge code.</li>

              <li>For relevant Affymetrix platforms you may also
              want the cdf and probe packages for that platform.
              These packages are named using the following
              convention: "platformName"cdf and
              "platformName"probe. Where "platformName" is the name
              of the chip platform that these packages refer
              to.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>All packages should be installed using biocLite().
            All annotation packages contain manual pages that
            describe each of the mappings that they provide. Users
            interested in getting more information about how to use
            these packages or create custom chip packages can also
            see the vignettes in AnnotationDbi package. There is
            additional information in the annotate package for how
            to use some of the extra tools provided. Information on
            how to use biomaRt, GOstats or other software packages
            can be found with each of those packages
            respectively.</p>
