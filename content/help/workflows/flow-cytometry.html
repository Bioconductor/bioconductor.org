            <h2>Key packages</h2>

            <p>Open source Bioconductor packages for analysis of
            flow cytometry data provides a unified framework for
            bioinformaticians to develop methods to analyze and
            interpret flow cytometry data. A workflow for analysis
            of flow cytometry data might involve the following
            packages.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/flowCore.html">
              flowCore</a> - handles importing, storing,
              preprocessing and assessment of data from flow
              cytometry experiments</li>

              <li><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/flowViz.html">
              flowViz</a> - provides graphical methods for
              visualization of flow cytometry data.</li>

              <li><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/flowQ.html">
              flowQ</a> - provides quality control and quality
              assessment tools for flow cytometry data</li>

              <li><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/flowStats.html">
              flowStats</a> - provides tools and methods to analyze
              flow cytometry data that are beyond the basic
              infrastructure provided in the flowCore package.</li>

              <li><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/flowUtils.html">
              flowUtils</a> - provides utilities, mainly to
              integrate foreign flow cytometry analysis tools.</li>

              <li><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/flowClust.html">
              flowClust</a> - provides tools for robust model based
              clustering using t mixture models with Box-Cox
              transformation.</li>

              <li><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/flowMerge.html">
              flowMerge</a> - provides tools for merging of mixture
              components for model based automated gating of flow
              cytometry data using the flowClust framework.</li>

              <li><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/flowFP.html">
              flowFP</a> - provides tools for fingerprint
              generation of flow cytometry data to facilitate the
              application of machine learning and data mining tools
              for flow cytometry.</li>

              <li><a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.6/bioc/html/iFlow.html">
              iFlow</a> - provides GUI and tools to explore,
              analyze, and visualize flow cytometry data. The
              tutorial video can be downloaded from <a href="../flowcytometry/tutorial.mpeg">here</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These packages can be installed using <a href="/install/">biocLite("package name")</a>. Each
            package also contains a detailed vignette illustrating
            typical use cases as well as man pages. The vignette
            for a package can be viewed using openVignette("package
            name")</p>

            <p>A typical workflow using the packages flowCore,
            flowViz, flowQ and flowStats is described in detail in
            <a href="../flowcytometry/flowWorkFlow.pdf">flowWorkFlow.pdf</a>.
            The data files used in the workflow can be downloaded
            from <a href="../flowcytometry/dataFiles.tar">here</a>.</p>
