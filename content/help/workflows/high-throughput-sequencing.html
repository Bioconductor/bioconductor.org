            <p>A work flow might involve the following packages,
            all available in the release version of
            Bioconductor</p>

            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ShortRead.html">
              ShortRead</a> for file I/O, quality assessment, and
              high-level, general purpose data summary.</li>

              <li><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biostrings.html">
              Biostrings</a> for alignment, pattern matching (e.g.,
              primer removal), and data manipulation of large
              biological sequences or sets of sequences. There are
              a series of pre-built <a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/AnnotationData.html">
              BSgenome.*</a> sequence annotation packages.</li>

              <li><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BSgenome.html">
              BSgenome</a> for accessing and manipulating curated
              whole-genome representations.</li>

              <li><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rtracklayer.html">
              rtracklayer</a> for import and export of tracks to
              browsers like the UCSC genome browser.</li>

              <li><a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/IRanges.html">
              IRanges</a> and <a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/genomeIntervals.html">
              genomeIntervals</a> for range-based (e.g.,
              chromosomal regions) calculation, data manipulation,
              and general-purpose data representation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Packages are installed using <a href="../../install">biocLite()</a>. These packages are
            under active development; those on the cutting edge
            might wish to use the development version of R, and
            hence the development version of the packages listed
            above. In addition, the <a href="https://hedgehog.fhcrc.org/bioconductor/trunk/madman/Rpacks/chipseq/">
            chipseq</a> package is available (as of 8 May 2009)
            using <a href="http://wiki.fhcrc.org/bioc/SvnHowTo">subversion</a>.</p>

            <p>Packages have extensive help pages, and include
            vignettes highlighting common use cases; the help pages
            and vignettes are available from within R (e.g.,
            ?DNAStringSet) and on the pages linked above.</p>
