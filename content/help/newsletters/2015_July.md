# *Bioconductor* Newsletter
{:.no_toc}

posted by [Valerie Obenchain](mailto:vobencha@fhcrc.org), July 2015

The `Bioconductor` newsletter is a quarterly review of core infrastructure
developments, community projects and future directions. We cover topics of
general interest as well as those with greatest impact on the software.  This
issue covers the build report shields that track use and usability metrics and
the newly minted `Bioconductor` Git/GitHub mirrors. We discuss improved tools
for navigating package repositories, revisit the 'OrganismDb' packages as a
framework for managing multiple annotations and Cole Trapnell shares his
thoughts on software development in the context of the 'monocle' package.

## Single Cell Analysis and the monocle package

Cole Trapnell is an Assistant Professor of Genome Sciences at the University of
Washington. He received his PhD in Computer Science from the University of
Maryland where was co-advised by researchers at University of California at
Berkeley. He spent several years in Berkeley as a visiting student where
he wrote TopHat and Cufflinks and co-wrote Bowtie with Ben Langmead. 
It was during a postdoc at Harvard in the Department of Stem Cell and
Regenerative Biology where he started to work with stem cells and became
interested in single-cell analysis. This led to the development of the [Monocle
algorithm](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/papers/trapnell-cacchiarelli-monocle/)
and eventually the 
[monocle](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.2/bioc/html/monocle.html)
`Bioconductor` package. Cole
will be speaking at the BioC 2015 conference in Seattle this year and will talk
in detail about the biological questions behind his research interests.  For
this interview I wanted to focus on his experience writing and maintaining
heavily used software and lessons learned. Here he shares his perspective as a
software developer specifically in the context of the 'monocle' `Bioconductor`
package.

## Infrastructure Updates

### Development plans for 'SummarizedExperiment' class

As many of you know the 'SummarizedExperiment' class is under construction. 
This class holds numeric and other data types derived from a sequencing 
experiment. The structure is rectangular with annotations on the rows and
columns. Historically the class held a 'GRanges' or 'GRangesList' in the 
'rowData' slot. Based on requests to add support for row-centric data 
(e.g., DataFrame) Herve, Jim, Martin and myself have been working on a 
redesign with credit going to Herv&eacute; for the majority of the work so far. 

The goals are to support both range-based and row-based data in a modular
design that is easy to extend. Other feedback from discussions on 
the bioc-devel mailing list will also be incorporated.

This is a work in progress and will require a couple of devel cycles to 
completely finish. Currently we have created a new package, 
SummarizedExperiment, that contains the new classes. 'SummarizedExperiment' in
the GenomicRanges package has been deprecated and will no longer be available
as of BioC 3.3.

Summary of new classes in the new SummarizedExperiment package:

* 'SummarizedExperiment0'

  New parent class supports row-based data only (i.e., DataFrame in
  @elementMetadata).  Once the old 'SummarizedExperiment' class in
  GenomicRanges has gone through the deprecation cycle, this will be renamed
  'SummarizedExperment'.

* 'RangedSummarizedExperiment'

  This class extends 'SummarizedExperiment0' by adding support for range-based
  data (i.e., GRanges or GRangesList in @rowRanges). Old 'SummarizedExperiment'
  objects must be updated to 'RangedSummarizedExperiment'. This class is
  functionally equivalent to the old 'SummarizedExperiment' class in the
  'GenomicRanges' package.


## `Bioconductor` Git/GitHub Mirrors 

The `Bioconductor` project is maintained in a Subversion(SVN) source control
system and has been since the early days of the project. As Git gained
popularity we experimented with making packages available via a 
[Git-SVN bridge](http://www.bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/git-svn/); 
commits in Git were propagated to SVN and visa versa. The bridge was very
popular hosting 221 packages, however, there were a few drawbacks. The bridge
did not contain complete commit history, other users must be granted permission
to access your repository and there were some reliability issues - the bridge
did go down. 

Recognizing the strengths and popularity of Git/GitHub we looked for a more
complete solution. The decision was to mirror the full package repository
and hence the creation of the
[Bioconductor Git Mirrors](https://github.com/Bioconductor-mirrors).
These are read-only repositories for every software package and are
synchronized with the SVN repository. These mirrors replace the Git-SVN bridge, 
which is now deprecated. Maintainers who are using the bridge should migrate 
to the Git mirrors. See the HOWTO section of the website for
[migration instructions](http://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/git-mirror/).

Thanks to Jim and Dan for their work on this. See the official 
[announcement](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/bioc-devel/2015-June/007675.html)
on bioc-devel.

Nate and Jim have offered up some of their favorite (and fun!) Git resources:

* [Git Internals](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects) 
from the Pro Git book

* [Git and GitHub with R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html) from
Hadleys book

* [github site documentation](https://help.github.com/)

* [interactive game](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) to learn 
Git commands

* [video game](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/) to master Git
branching and basic commands


## Reproducible Research

### Package end of life policy

Bioconductor aims to provide stable and relevant software to users across the
community. The number of packages continues to grow and as of June 2015 the
repository hosts 1024 software, 241 experimental data and 883 annotation
packages. Software and experimental data packages are built and checked
regularly, ensuring that functions operate as expected and necessary
dependencies are available. Before each release the Seattle team contacts
maintainers of packages that are failing build or check so the new release is
as clean as possible.

Inevitably, packages become abandoned as the maintainer moves on or as one
technology is exchanged for another. Whether it is an active decision on the
part of the maintainer or the maintainer cannot be found, we needed a way to
mark such packages for retirement. Along these lines we recently adopted a 
package 
[end of life
policy](http://www.bioconductor.org/developers/package-end-of-life/). This 
applies to all software, experimental data and annotation packages that no
longer pass build or check and do not have an active maintainer.  Packages are
considered for end of life deprecation prior to each Bioconductor release. When
a package enters the deprecation phase an announcement is made on the support
site to offer the package up for adoption. The first successful adoption was of
the triform package by Tom Caroll. Thanks Tom! 

### Package management

With over 2000 packages across the 3 repositories effective tools for package
qc and management are essential. We aim to provide packages that meet the
standard criteria in the package review process, build across supported
platforms, are readily available (svn, biocLite() and now Git) and discoverable
(i.e., best package for the job).

Over the years Marc, and now Sonali, have established a number of systems for
the tracking, quality control and categorization of packages. Through their own
innovation and community feedback they create tools that improve the way we
interact with these repositories. Much of this work is used internally
and is not public-facing. This section highlights recent additions that 
are visible (and hopefully useful) to all.

#### 'ReproducibleResearch' biocViews term

'biocViews' terms allows for powerful topic-specific searches across the
package repositories.  These terms are revised and updated as technologies
change and new data formats become available.  The newest addition is the term
'ReproducibleResearch'. This is reserved for packages containing reproducible
data and results from a publication and is intended to distinguish them from
the typical experimental data package. 

#### 'recommendPackages()' function

Sonali has recently added the 'recommendPackages()' function to the 'biocViews'
package. This function helps identify packages tagged with one or more
'biocViews' terms. For example, this call returns all packages tagged with both
"Cheminformatics" and "clustering" in the devel branch:

    library(biocViews)
    terms <- c("Cheminformatics", "clustering")
    ## >     recommendPackages(terms, use.release = TRUE, intersect.views = TRUE)
    ## [1] "ChemmineOB" "ChemmineR"  "eiR"        "fmcsR"

Packages with a particular 'biocViews' term can also be located by using the
web interface, however, 'recommendPackages()' offers the ability to intersect
terms thereby searching by more than one view.

A list of valid biocViews terms can be found on the web site for 
[release](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html) and
[devel](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/BiocViews.html).

#### "pre-accepted" package status

A new status term, "pre-accepted", has been added to the package tracker.
This term is used for new packages that have been approved by a reviewer 
but have not yet had a successful build report. Once the package has a clean 
build and check the status is changed to "accepted". This status applies to 
new packages only.


### Build report

Quite a bit going on with the build report this past quarter. Here are
the highlights.

#### shields

The build report now includes shields (aka badges) that summarize use
and usability metrics of each package. Motivation was to provide a quick and
easy way for users to assess the package. If a search on 'biocViews' terms
returns a number of packages suitable for an analysis the shield metrics
can provide an additional level of assessment and help further narrow the field.

The shields provide the following metrics:

* cross-platform availability
* build report status
* how long the package has been in Bioconductor
* download percentile over the last 6 months
* average number of SVN commits over the last 6 months
* support site activity (questions/comments/responses) over the last 6 months
* percentage of code "covered" by unit tests


Shields are can be used externally as well. For example, to display build 
status on a README in Github the image can be pulled from the
[release](http://bioconductor.org/shields/build/release/bioc/BiocGenerics.svg)
or 
[devel](http://bioconductor.org/shields/build/devel/bioc/BiocGenerics.svg)
shield.

To follow the complete discussion see the 
[post](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/bioc-devel/2015-May/007500.html)
on Bioc-devel.

Thanks to Jim and Dan for the work on the shields.

#### short urls for packages

There was a request to have the Bioconductor website resolve shortened package
urls. The use case was in the context of grants and publications where
referring to a package with the full length url can be cumbersome and
distracting.

Previously the full path to a package had to be specified:

    http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BiocGenerics.html


The generic short form takes you to the release page unless the package
is only available in devel:

    http://bioconductor.org/packages/BiocGenerics

Also supported are short forms that specify release or devel or a numbered
Bioconductor version:

http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/BiocGenerics
http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocGenerics
http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.2/BiocGenerics
http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.1/BiocGenerics
http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.0/BiocGenerics

The short URLs can be used in publications and other sites and
they are useful as a permanent link to the current release version of a
package. Information about these short URLs has been added to the email 
we send to new package developers so they can use them in publications that
reference their packages.

To follow the full discussion on short urls see the bioc-devel
[post](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/bioc-devel/2015-April/007464.html).
Thanks goes to Dan.


### Increase awareness of support site messages

The Bioconductor 
[support site](https://support.bioconductor.org) sees quite a bit of traffic. 
There is an average of 900 posts per month if we count top-level
questions, answers and comments. Tracking and filtering pertinent messages can
be time-consuming. To help with getting a message to the right pair of eyes
Dan has implemented a few scripts to ensure maintainers are aware of posts
that pertain to their packages.

The first script looks at the "watched tags" field of the user profile.  Adding
a package to "watched tags" triggers an email to be sent every time someone
posts a question tagged with the (lowercase) package name. The script checks to
make sure all package maintainers who are registered on the support site have
all the packages they maintain in their "watched tags" field.

A second script identifies maintainers who do not have logins on the support
site. The email address in the Maintainer field of the package should be the
same used to register on the support site.

Finally, BiocCheck has been modified to make sure the maintainer is registered
on the support site. For new packages, which are required to pass BiocCheck,
this is now a requirement.


## Annotations

### TxDb objects

The Bioconductor TxDb object is a container for storing transcript annotations.
Many methods have been written to query and subset the underlying database
making the class a useful format to store information from UCSC, Ensembl and
BioMart resources.

Functions for converting data to and from a TxDb have been around for some
time and greatly improve the ability to wrangle data between online sources 
and `Bioconductor`. A few new functions were added recently and I think they
are worth knowing about. Thanks to Marc and Herve for their work on these.

* makeTxDbFromGFF
* makeTxDbFromUCSC
* makeTxDbFromBiomart
* makeTxDbFromGRanges (new)
* makeOrganismDbFromTxDb (new)

More details are on the man page in the 'GenomicFeatures' package.

    library(GenomicFeatures)
    ?makeTxDbFromUCSC

### 'OrganismDbi'  package and 'OrganismDb' objects

The 'OrganismDbi' package provides classes and methods for interfacing with a
collection of annotation packages. The 'OrganismDb' class is a composite object
composed of multiple annotation packages linked through a common key.  The
prototype packages contain a TxDb, GO.db and org.*.eg.db combination for a
specific organism and genome build. The intent is that any collection of
existing annotation packages could be bundled to make an organism package as
long as they have a common mapping.

Currently there are 3 'OrganismDbi' packages, Homo.sapiens, Mus.musculus and 
Rattus.norvegicus. These can be found by searching the 
[annotation repository](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/BiocViews.html#___AnnotationData)
with the biocViews term "OrganismDb".

For more on creating your own package see the man page in the 'OrganismDbi' 
package.

    library(OrganismDbi)
    ?makeOrganismPackage

Accessing data in these objects can be done with the 'select()' interface or
more recently with one of Marc's new range accessor functions.

* selectByRanges(x, ranges, columns, overlaps, ignore.strand)

  Overlaps a set of user-supplied ranges with the annotations in an
  'OrganismDb'. The return value is a 'GRanges' with mcols that contain
  the data specified in the 'columns' argument.
  The 'overlaps' argument dictates the gene region for overlap
  such as 'tx', 'exons', 'cds'
  etc.

* selectRangesByID(x, keys, columns, keytype, feature)

  Matches the ID specified by 'keys' and 'keytype' to the annotations
  in 'OrganismDb'. The return value is a 'GRangesList' where each
  list element is defined by the gene region in 'feature' such as
  'gene', 'tx', 'exon' or 'cds'. Metadata columns on the individual
  'GRanges' elements contain the data specified in 'columns'.


### AnnotationHub update

#### propagate metadata

Resources available in 'AnnotationHub' have been downloaded from external
sources and saved as pre-parsed `R` objects or as raw data files.  Each
resource in the hub has associated metadata organized into 10 categories.

    library(AnnotationHub)
    hub <- AnnotationHub()

    ## > names(mcols(hub))
    ##  [1] "title"       "dataprovider" "species"    "taxonomyid" "genome"
    ##  [6] "description" "tags"         "rdataclass" "sourceurl"  "sourcetype"

This is useful information to keep with the object once extracted from the hub.
Sonali is working on propagating these fields to the @metadata slot of the `R`
objects. If a resource is a file, such as FASTA or VCF, these fields will are
added to the @metadata slot of the 'DNAStringSet' or 'VCF' object when the
extracted with '[['. This is a work in progress and is scheduled to be complete
for the fall `Bioconductor` release.

#### new resources

Ensembl release 80 files (both GTF and FASTA):

    query(hub, c('gtf', '80', 'ensembl')) 
    query(hub, c('fasta', '80', 'ensembl')) 

Epigenomics RoadMap Project files:

    query(hub, 'EpigenomeRoadMap')

'OrgDb' packages:

    query(hub, 'OrgDb')

### Package downloads and new submissions 

The number of unique IP downloads of software packages for April, May and
June of 2015 were 38853, 37784 and 32426 respectively.  For the same time
period in 2014, numbers were 39818, 38348 and 36179. Numbers must be
compared by month (vs sum) because some IPs are the same between months.
See the web site for a full summary of [download
stats](http://bioconductor.org/packages/stats/).

A total of 47 software packages were added in the second quarter of 2015 
bringing counts to 1038 in devel (`Bioconductor` 3.3) and 1024 in release 
(`Bioconductor` 3.2).


## Tutorials

The `Bioconductor` support site now hosts a
[tutorials page](https://support.bioconductor.org/t/Tutorials/). Sean Davis
has contributed one on using dplyr and GEOmetadb to mine NCBI GEO data and
another on accessing public genomic data from `Bioconductor`. Sonali's 
tutorial gives an overview of the new Epigenomics RoadMap Project files 
available in 'AnnotationHub'.
