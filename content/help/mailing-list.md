about problems and solutions using Bioconductor, enhancements and
patches to the source code and documentation of Bioconductor, as
well as general discussions on topics of interest to the
Bioconductor community.


Send mail to everyone subscribed to the bioconductor mail list by
reading the [posting guide][5] and then sending an email to

## bioc-devel ##

Subscribe to or browse this list through the [web interface][8].

This list is for discussions about the active and future development
of Bioconductor, and pre-testing of new versions. It is meant for
those who maintain active positions in the development of Bioconductor
(members of Biocore and developers of contributed packages) as well as
others who have an interest in keeping up to date with these matters.

## bioc-sig-sequencing ##

Subscribe to or browse this list through the [web interface][9].


This list is for discussion and development of Bioconductor packages
for analysis of ultra-high throughput sequencing data. Ultra-high
throughput data comes from Solexa, 454, and other similar
technologies. The SIG focuses on development, but welcomes input from
users facing statistical, analytic or other challenges that require a
package-level solution.
