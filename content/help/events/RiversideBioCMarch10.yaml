title: Searching and Clustering Drug-like Compounds in R and BioC 
location: Riverside, CA, USA
event_host: UCR
start: 2010-03-06
end:   2010-03-06
description:
  This workshop introduces the ChemmineR package for mining drug-like compound
  and screening data sets. The R package contains functions for structural
  similarity searching, clustering of compound libraries with a wide spectrum
  of algorithms and utilities for managing complex compound data sets. In
  addition, it offers visualization functions for compound clusters and
  chemical structures. The package is well integrated with the online ChemMine
  database and allows bidirectional communications between the two
  services. The integration of chemoinformatic tools with the R programming
  environment has many advantages, such as easy access to a wide spectrum of
  statistical methods, machine learning algorithms and graphic
  utilities. Knowledge of the R software, as introduced in the "Introduction
  into R" course, will be required for attending this workshop.
