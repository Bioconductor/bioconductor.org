  text: "This course will provide biologists and bioinformaticians with practical  statistical analysis skills to perform rigorous analysis of high-throughput  genomic data. The course assumes basic familiarity with genomics and with R programming, but does not assume prior statistical training.  It covers the statistical concepts necessary to design experiments and analyze high-throughput data generated by next-generation sequencing, including: exploratory data analysis, principal components analysis, clustering, differential expression, and gene set analysis"
