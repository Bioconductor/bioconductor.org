  text: "This course will introduce participants to the analysis and exploration of mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics data using R and Bioconductor. The course will cover all levels of MS data, from raw data to identification and quantitation data, up to the statistical interpretation of a typical shotgun MS experiment and will focus on hands-on tutorials. At the end of this course, the participants will be able to manipulate MS data in R and use existing packages for their exploratory and statistical proteomics data analysis."
