  text: "This course will provide biologists and bioinformaticians with practical statistical analysis skills to perform rigorous analysis of high-throughput genomic data. The course assumes basic familiarity with genomics and with R programming, but does not assume prior statistical training. It covers the statistical concepts necessary to analyze genomic and transcriptomic high-throughput data generated by next-generation sequencing, including: hypothesis testing, data visualization, genomic region analysis, differential expression analysis, and gene set analysis."
