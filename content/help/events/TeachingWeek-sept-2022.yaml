  text: "The Bioconductor teaching committee invites anyone interested in Bioconductor and education, learners and educators, to join us to discuss your needs and ideas in terms of education. We are looking for your ideas, suggestions and time (if available) to define and discuss our future efforts. What community resources have worked for you? What is missing? What is the best learning resource/experience that you found recently, and that we should add? What was the hardest thing you had to learn to do in Bioconductor?"
