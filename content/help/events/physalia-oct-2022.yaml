  text: "This course aims at making Bioconductor package development within oneâ€™s reach. It is specifically designed for biologists and newer bioinformaticians who may find themselves using R/Bioconductor packages and who wish to expand their programmatic toolkit. Overall, this course will help the attendees gain accurate insights into the fundamental notions required for proper R/Bioconductor package development. We will cover key theory concepts about package development and the Bioconductor ecosystem, supported by a range of demonstrations and exercises, to get a complete understanding of all the steps of package development. Throughout this workshop, we will emphasise on the best practices for developing a package embedded in the R/Bioconductor ecosystem."
