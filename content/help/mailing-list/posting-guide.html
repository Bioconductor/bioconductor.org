<h1>Posting guide for Bioconductor mailing lists</h1>

            <h2>Before sending mail to the list</h2>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Read the relevant R documentation.
                If you are having trouble with function somefunc,
                try help("somefunc"). If you are searching for a
                function, try help.search("somefunc").
                Alternatively, use help.start() to start the HTML
                search engine.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Make sure your question hasn't
                already been answered by searching the <a href="http://bioconductor.org/docs/faq/">FAQ</a>.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Read the vignette(s) for the
                package(s) you are using:</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <pre>
## List available vignettes for "somepkg"<br />
vignette(package="somepkg")<br />
## open the "intro" vingnette in "somepkg"<br />
vignette("intro", package="somepkg")<br />
</pre>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Check the <a href="http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.science.biology.informatics.conductor">
                BioConductor mailing list archives</a> and the
                <a href="http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/">R-help mailing
                list archive</a> to see if your question has been
                asked (and answered) already.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Try a <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> search.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>See if the error is reproducible
                when you run the code again from a fresh R session
                or if you use a slightly different dataset.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Ensure that you have <a href="http://bioconductor.org/docs/install/">updated
                installed packages</a> to their current
                version.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>While sending mail to the list</h2>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Start a new mail instead of
                replying to an existing mail and changing the
                subject.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Use an informative subject line.
                This will help attract responders and also helps
                others in the future when they search the
                archives.</p>
              </li>

              <li>Identify yourself. Anonymous postings are much
              less likely to get responses.<br /></li>

              <li>
                <p>If possible, send a simple and
                reproducible example along with the output of
                sessionInfo(). If the example produces an error,
                also provide the error message and the output of
                traceback().</p>
              </li>

              <li>Choose your audience appropriately:

                <dl>
                  <dt>BioConductor mailing list</dt>

                  <dd>For general question using Bioconductor
                  packages and bioinformatics. Note that questions
                  that are conceptual in nature are welcomed
                  here.</dd>

                  <dt>Direct email to package maintainer</dt>

                  <dd>Alternatively, if the package is in
                  development version, you can try asking the
                  package authors directly.</dd>

                  <dt>R-help mailing list</dt>

                  <dd>R-help is more suited questions that have to
                  do with the underlying R program.</dd>

                  <dt>BioC-devel and R-devel</dt>

                  <dd>These lists are for discussing code
                  development and other more technical stuff.</dd>
                </dl>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Read your mail again. Have you
                stated your goal and objectives clearly? Keep your
                mail as precise and concise as you can.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Some optional settings</h2>

            <ol>
              <li>Please use plain text instead of HTML as will be
              easier to detect spam and malicious software. Plain
              texts are also smaller in size and easier to
              read.</li>

              <li>Ensure that your lines are wrapped at about 72
              characters, which makes postings more readable.
              Otherwise one paragraph will be rendered on one long
              line when someone replies to your mail. See this
              webpage (<a href="http://expita.com/nomime.html">http://expita.com/nomime.html</a>)
              for instructions on how to configure your mail client
              to send plain text and line wrapping.</li>

              <li>Try to ensure that your codes are readable. Long
              lines of codes should be simplified and have new
              lines at the appropriate places. Note that as a
              consequence of line wrapping, your codes may wrap at
              unexpected places.</li>

              <li>The only allowed attachment is PS, PDF, JPG, PNG
              (?) and mail must be less that 40 KB in size.
              Otherwise your mail will require administrator
              approval before being posted.</li>

              <li>Learn to write in clear, grammatical,
              correctly-spelled language. If your mail client
              supports a spell check, please utilize it. Otherwise
              compose in a word composer beforehand that has these
              features.</li>

              <li>Read over your mail. Is it easy to understand and
              does your mail sound polite? Remember that
              BioConductor and its mailing list is created and
              maintained by volunteers who are not paid technical
              support people.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>When replying to mail on the list</h2>

            <ol>
              <li>Respond to everyone in the list, which ensures
              that your response is archived.</li>

              <li>If possible, write an answer that can be
              understood by readers with different scientific
              backgrounds and skill levels / skill profiles.</li>

              <li>When answering a question, consider including
              some explanation of how you arrived at your solution
              (rather than just writing a solution). This way, you
              help people not only to solve their problem at hand,
              but also to help themselves in the future.</li>

              <li>Rudeness and ad hominem comments are not
              acceptable.</li>

              <li>Brevity is OK. Consider, though, that information
              that is obvious and not worth mentioning to you may
              be very helpful to others.</li>

              <li>If you believe the issue has been discussed
              before, please give the URL of the relevant thread or
              website.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Why a posting guide ?</h2>

            <ol>
              <li>Good questions attract good responses.</li>

              <li>The act of formulating good questions can help to
              solve the problem itself.</li>

              <li>Good questions avoid wasting other people's time
              and avoids embarrassment.</li>
            </ol>
