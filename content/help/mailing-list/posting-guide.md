## Why? ##

* Good questions attract good responses.

* Formulating a good question can help point to the answer.

* Good questions help avoid embarrassment.

## Preparing ##

* Read the relevant R documentation.  Use `help.start()` to start the
  HTML search engine. If you are having trouble with function
  `somefunc`, try `?somefunc`. If you are searching for a function,
  try `help.search("somefunc")`. Read the vignette(s) for the
  package(s) using `browseVignettes(package="somepkg")`

* Search the [FAQ](http://bioconductor.org/docs/faq/) and
  [Bioconductor](http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.science.biology.informatics.conductor)
  and [R-help](http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/) archives for
  similar posts. Try a [Google](http://www.google.com/) search.
  
* Simplify code to a minimal, self-contained example. If reporting an
  error, be sure to reproduce the error in a new R session, started
  with the `--vanilla` option to avoid loading .Rprofile or .RData
  files.
  
* Ensure that your installed packages are [up-to-date](/install/).

## Composing ##

* Start a new email message instead of replying to an existing email
  and changing the subject.
  
* Use an informative subject line.  This will help attract responders
  and also helps others in the future when they search the archives.

* Identify yourself. Anonymous postings are much less likely to get
  responses.

* Include a simple and reproducible example along with the output of
  `sessionInfo()`. If the example produces an error, provide the error
  message and the output of `traceback()`.

* Send email to the appropriate list.  Use the Bioconductor mailing
  list for questions about specific package, or conceptual
  questions. The R-help mailing list is for questions about the
  underlying R program. The Bioc-devel and R-devel lists are for
  discussing code development and other technical issues.

* Ensure that your code is readable, and can be cut and pasted into an
  R session.

* Use plain text instead of HTML; it is smaller in size and easier to
  read.

* The following attachment types are accepted: png, pdf, rda/Rdata. Total 
  message size cannot exceed 1MB. If larger attachments are essential, post
  them to a publicly accessible location and include the link in
  your email.

* Read over your mail. Is it polite and easy to understand? Remember
  that responses on the Bioconductor mailing list are from volunteers.

## Replying ##

* Respond to everyone in the list, which ensures that your response is
  archived.

* If possible, write an answer that can be understood by readers with
  different scientific backgrounds and skill levels / skill
  profiles.

* When answering a question, consider including some explanation of
  how you arrived at your solution (rather than just writing a
  solution). This way, you help people not only to solve their problem
  at hand, but also to help themselves in the future.

* Rudeness and ad hominem comments are not acceptable.

* Brevity is OK. Consider, though, that information that is obvious
  and not worth mentioning to you may be very helpful to others.

* If you believe the issue has been discussed before, please give the
  URL of the relevant thread or web site.
