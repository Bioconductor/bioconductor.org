# BioC 2016: Where Software and Biology Connect

June 25-26, 2016 (Developer Day: June 24)<br />
Stanford University, Stanford, CA<br />

This conference highlights current developments within and beyond
_Bioconductor_. Morning scientific talks and afternoon practicals
provide conference participants with insights and tools required for
the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic
data. 'Developer Day' precedes the main conference on June 24,
providing developers and would-be developers an opportunity to gain
insights into project direction and software development best
practices.

Speaker, workshop, and additional information coming soon. Travel and
accommodation are participant's responsibilities. For more
information, see [useR! 2016 Lodging][]; there are a limited number of
Stanford dorm rooms available. Stay after the conference for
_[useR! 2016]_.

A limited number of scholarships are available. The scholarships
include registration, shared accomodation, and up to $500 travel
expenses. Preference is given to individuals actively particpating in
the _Bioconductor_ community, e.g., contributing to the support site
or authoring packages. See the [Scholarship Application][].
