# BioC 2016: Where Software and Biology Connect

June 25-26, 2016 (Developer Day: June 24)<br />
Stanford University, Stanford, CA<br />

This conference highlights current developments within and beyond
_Bioconductor_. Morning scientific talks and afternoon practicals
provide conference participants with insights and tools required for
the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic
data. 'Developer Day' precedes the main conference on June 24,
providing developers and would-be developers an opportunity to gain
insights into project direction and software development best
practices.

Speaker, workshop, and additional information coming soon. Travel and
accommodation are participant's responsibilities. For more
