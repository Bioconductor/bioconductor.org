description: |-
  This is a two-day course introducing R and Bioconductor for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic (sequencing, microarray, ...) data. There are no pre-requisites. The course will be offered January 21 and 22; it is open and free of charge to students, staff, and faculty at Roswell Park Cancer Institute or SUNY at Buffalo.
  UNFORTUNATELY, the original course dates are FULL. Please REGISTER anyway, we are working to identify additional times. Registrants will be updated early next week, e.g., December 16.
