description: The one-week intensive course Statistical Data Analysis
  for Genome-Scale Biology teaches statistical and computational
  analysis of multi-omics studies in biology and biomedicine. It
  covers the underlying theory and state of the art (the morning
  lectures), and practical hands-on exercises based on the R /
  Bioconductor environment (the afternoon labs). The course covers the
  primary analysis of high-throughput sequencing based assays in
  functional genomics and integrative methods including efficiently
  operating with genomic intervals, statistical testing, linear
  models, machine learning, bioinformatic annotation and
  visualization. At the end of the course, you should be able to run
  analysis workflows on your own (multi-)omic data, adapt and combine
  different tools, and make informed and scientifically sound choices
  about analysis strategies.  The course is intended for researchers
  who have basic familiarity with the experimental technologies and
  their applications in biology, and who are interested in making the
  step from a user of bioinformatics software towards adapting or
  developing their own analysis workflows.
