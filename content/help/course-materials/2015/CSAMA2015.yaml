description: The one-week intensive course Statistics and Computing in
  Genome Data Science teaches statistical and computational analysis
  of multi-omics studies in biology and biomedicine. It covers the
  underlying theory and state of the art (the morning lectures), and
  practical hands-on exercises based on the R / Bioconductor
  environment (the afternoon labs). The course covers the primary
  analysis ("preprocessing") of high-throughput sequencing based
  assays in functional genomics (transcriptomics, epigenetics, etc.)
  as well as integrative methods including efficiently operating with
  genomic intervals, statistical testing, linear models, machine
  learning, bioinformatic annotation and visualization. At the end of
  the course, you should be able to run analysis workflows on your own
  (multi-)omic data, adapt and combine different tools, and make
  informed and scientifically sound choices about analysis strategies.
  The course is intended for researchers who have basic familiarity
  with the experimental technologies and their applications in
  biology, and who are interested in making the step from a user of
  bioinformatics software towards adapting or developing their own
  analysis workflows. The four practical sessions of the course will
  require you to follow (and hopefully, modify) scripts in the
  computer language R.
