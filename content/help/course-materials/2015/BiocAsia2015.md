## Overview

The _Bioconductor_ project is a widely used collection of over 1000 R
packages for high-throughput genomic analysis and recently surpassed
the milestone of 100,000 commits to its svn repository. Many popular
software tools from the project are developed by researchers based in
the Asia-Pacific region. To enhance collaborations and provide an
avenue for networking, the region's first developer's meeting will be
held directly preceding GIW/InCoB 2015. This event will bring together
both current and prospective package developers to provide a forum for
exchanging ideas and future plans for software in the project.  The
meeting will consist of a number of longer talks selected from
abstracts as well as short 'lightning' presentations to maximize the
opportunities for participants to highlight their work. A Developer
workshop on 'Turning great ideas into _Bioconductor_ packages with
impact' will also be held.
