# BioC 2015: Where Software and Biology Connect

July 21-22, 2015 (Developer Day: July 20)<br />
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA

This conference highlights current developments within and beyond
Bioconductor. Morning scientific talks and afternoon practicals
provide conference participants with insights and tools required for
the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic
data. 'Developer Day' preceeds the main conference on July 20,
providing developers and would-be developers an opportunity to gain
insights into project direction and software development best
practices.
