description: This course is directed at intermediate users wanting to make effective
  use of R and Bioconductor for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput
  sequence data. The morning provides overall orientation to the packages and facilities
  available in Bioconductor, including and in-depth look at the central GenomicRanges
  infrastructure. The afternoon provides approaches to common challenges -- working
  with large data, placing statistical results in biological context, and effectively
  and reliably communicating results with other team members. The course combines
  lectures with extensive hands-on practicals; participants are required to bring
  a laptop with wireless internet access and a modern version of the Chrome or Safari
  web browser.
