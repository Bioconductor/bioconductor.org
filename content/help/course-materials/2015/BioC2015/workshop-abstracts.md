# BioC 2015 Workshop Abstracts

### Detecting differentially bound regions in ChIP-seq data with [csaw](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/csaw.html). 

Aaron Lun.

### Basics of image data and spatial patterns analysis in _R_.

Andrzej Oles, Wolfgang Huber. 

### An introduction to _R_ and _Bioconductor_.

_Bioconductor_ Core Team. 

### Working with _docker_ and _AMI_ containers for _R_, _Biconductor_, and common workflow language / [Rabix](https://www.rabix.org) integration.

Dan Tenenbaum (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.), Tengfei Yin. 

### Gating Designed Experiments With [openCyto](/packages/openCyto/).

Greg Finak (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.)

This workshop will cover flow cytometry and CyTOF data analysis in
BioConductor using the [OpenCyto](/packages/openCyto) framework. Users
will learn to read in raw data, perform compensation and
transformation and gating, and generate figures using the new ggcyto
visualization framework based on ggplot. The focus will be on designed
experiments where multiple samples are matched (e.g. as treatment and
control). Users will learn how to use OpenCyto to leverage the
positive and negative control samples to derive data-driven gates.

### FAQ Live! Common questions and expert solutions, delivered in person.

James MacDonald. 

### Methylation.

Kasper Hansen. 

### [SGSeq](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SGSeq.html) and alternative splicing.

Leonard Goldstein

### Challenges and opportunities from integrative analysis of multi-omic data sets.

Levi Waldron, Tim Triche, Aedin Culhane. 

### _Bioconductor_ annotation resources.

Marc Carlson, Sonali Arora (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.)

### Differential expression, manipulation, and visualization of RNA-seq reads.

Mike Love. 

### [GoogleGenomics](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/GoogleGenomics.html).

Nicole Deflaux,

### Approaches to management and analysis of large genomic data.

Valerie Obenchain, Martin Morgan, et al. (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.)
