description: 'This course is directed at beginning and intermediate users who would
  like an introduction to the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput sequence
  data using R and Bioconductor. Day 1 focuses on learning essential background: an
  introduction to the R programming language; central concepts for effective use of
  Bioconductor software; and an overview of high-throughput sequence analysis work
  flows. The morning of Day 2 emphasizes use of Bioconductor for specific tasks, and
  in particular takes detailed look at RNA-seq differential expression work flow.
  The afternoon of Day 2 transitions to understanding effective approaches for managing
  larger challenges: strategies for working with large data, writing re-usable functions,
  developing reproducible reports and work flows, and visualizing results. The course
  combines lectures with extensive hands-on practicals; participants are required
  to bring a laptop with wireless internet access and a modern version of the Chrome
  or Safari web browser.'
