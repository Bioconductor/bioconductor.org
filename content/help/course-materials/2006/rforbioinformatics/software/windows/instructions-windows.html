              <p>The file Rminicourse-WinToolset.zip contains the
              tools you'll need.</p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>Start by 'unzipping'
                  Rminicourse-WinToolset.zip. To do this: Find
                  Rminicourse-WinToolset.zip on your desktop,
                  right-click on the icon, and choose 'Extract
                  all...' from the menu. Follow the on-screen
                  instructions, and extract the files into a
                  convenient place on your computer. It will be
                  easier to extract it at the 'top level' of your
                  hard drive, e.g., C:\Rminicourse-WinToolset. The
                  folder you have just created should contain the
                  following files:</p>
                  <pre>
Rtools.zip<br />
MinGW-5.0.0.exe<br />
ActivePerl-5.6.1.638-MSWin32-x86.msi<br />
htmlhelp.exe<br />
README.TXT<br />
</pre>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Rtools. Find the folder
                  'Rtools.zip' in the directory you've just
                  extracted. Right-click on Rtools.zip, and choose
                  'Extract All...'. Follow the instructions to
                  extract the files into a top level directory,
                  e.g., c:\Rtools. It is VERY IMPORTANT that Rtools
                  is in a top level directory.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>MinGW. (NB: make sure that any
                  earlier versions of MinGW have been uninstalled
                  before starting this procedure) Return to the
                  "Rminicourse-WinToolset" directory, and double
                  click on the "MinGW-5.0.0.exe" file. Follow the

                  <p>Choose to install the 'Candidate' version of
                  MinGW.</p>

                  <p>Select MinGW base tools, g++ compiler, and g77
                  compiler</p>

                  <p>The 'Destination location' must be a top-level
                  directory, preferably the default c:\MinGW.</p>
                </li>

                <li>

              <h1><a href="instructions-windows.html#id5" name="further-configuration-and-testing">Further configuration
              and testing</a></h1>

              <p>Windows needs to be provided with information
              about where the tools you have installed can be
              found. You need to modify so-called 'Environment
              variables' to provide this information. To do
              this:</p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>From the 'Start' menu, choose
                  'Control panels'. Then double click on the
                  'System' control panel, and choose the 'Advanced'
                  tab. Click on the 'Environment Variables'
                  button.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>This is a tricky step. We want
                  to provide a particular value to a variable
                  called PATH. Check in the 'System variables'
                  list. If there is a variable named PATH, then
                  select it and choose 'Edit'. If the PATH variable
                  does NOT exist in the System variables list, look
                  for PATH in the User variables list and, if it
                  exists, select it and choose 'Edit'. If there is
                  no PATH variable in either list, choose 'New' in
                  the user variable list.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>You will be presented with a
                  dialog box with two pieces of information. Make
                  sure the variable name is PATH. Assuming you are
                  creating a new PATH variable, enter the following
                  for the 'Variable value':</p>
                  <pre>
.;C:\Rtools\bin;C:\Perl\bin;C:\MinGW\bin;c:\Program Files\HTML Help Workshop<br />
</pre>

                  <p>If you are editing an existing variable, then
                  place this information IN FRONT of any values
                  that already exist. It is worth figuring out what
                  is going on here. You are providing Windows with
                  locations where Windows will look to try and find
                  programs. Further, you are telling Windows the
                  order in which it should look for programs: first
                  in the 'current' directory (that's the . at the
                  front), then in c:\RTools\bin, then... When asked
                  to find a program with some name, Windows will
                  use the first program with a matching name. Small
                  typing errors, missing or incorrectly ordered
                  directories will cause problems later.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Close the 'Edit User Variables',
                  'Environment Variables', and 'System Properties'
                  windows, saving changes each time.</p>
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>You're now ready to test the configuration. To do
              this:</p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>start a DOS shell by choosing
                  the Start menu, then the 'Run...' item. You will
                  be asked to type the name of a program for
                  Windows to open for you. Type:</p>
                  <pre>
cmd<br />
</pre>

                  <p>This creates a DOS shell, where commands can
                  be entered.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Look at your path. Type:</p>
                  <pre>
set PATH<br />
</pre>

                  <p>Make sure that the Path starts with
                  ".;c:\Rtools\bin;". If not, it is likely that a
                  System variable is defined and named PATH, but
                  you edited the user variable. Return to a
                  previous step and edit the PATH System
                  variable.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Test Rtools. First, list files
                  in the Rtools directory by typing:</p>
                  <pre>
dir c:\Rtools\bin<br />
</pre>

                  <p>You will see a number of programs (files
                  ending with '.exe'). Try typing:</p>
                  <pre>
tar --version<br />
</pre>

                  <p>This should provide output that starts with
                  'tar (GNU tar) ...'. Now type:</p>
                  <pre>
c:\Rtools\bin\tar --version<br />
</pre>

                  <p>The output from these two commands should
                  match exactly. Do the same for gcc, making sure
                  that the version number is 3.4.4. While you're at
                  it, you might do:</p>
                  <pre>
ls c:\Rtools\bin<br />
</pre>

                  <p>and find some useful unix-like commands
                  (including 'ls', which lists files much like DIR
                  does).</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Test perl. Try:</p>
                  <pre>
perl --version<br />
</pre>

                  <p>and check to see that the version is
                  5.6.1.</p>
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>Follow the instructions on the MikTeX web site
              (link above) to install LaTeX. Make sure that PATH
              contains c:\texmf\miktex\bin.</p>

              source</a></h1>

              <p>Here are the step for building R from source.</p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>Download the R 'tarball' file,
                  R-2.3.r36984.tgz, from the location given
                  above.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Unpack the tarball. Choose a
                  directory path WITHOUT spaces in the path name. A
                  good place is a top-level directory, e.g., c:\R.
                  We'll call this directory R_HOME. Open a DOS
                  shell (Start --&gt; Run --&gt; cmd), change to
                  the top-level of the C drive:</p>
                  <pre>
cd c:\<br />
</pre>

                  <p>(change to another directory if you want to
                  install R in a different location) and extract
                  the R files:</p>
                  <pre>
tar zxvf c:\Path\to\R-2.3.r36984.tgz<br />
</pre>

                  <p>The 'zxvf' are options. provided to the tar
                  command. If you're wondering what they mean, try
                  the command tar --help.</p>

                  <p>tar will extract the files to a folder called
                  R-2.3.r36984. Rename this to R-2.3, with:</p>
                  <pre>
mv R-2.3.r36984 R-2.3<br />
</pre>

                  <p>(this is the same as the DOS command REN
                  R-2.3.r36984 R2-3; mv ('move') is a version of a
                  standard unix command, and is one of the
                  Rtools).</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Execute the following
                  commands:</p>
                  <pre>
cd c:\R-2.3\src\gnuwin32<br />
make<br />
make bitmapdll<br />
make recommended<br />
</pre>

                  <p>These should generate a lot of screen output,
                  and each might take several minutes to
                  complete.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>As a convenience, you can tell
                  Windows where to find R. Do this by adding
                  c:\R-2.3\bin to the PATH variable, as outlined
                  above. Start a new DOS shell after setting the
                  PATH variable, because DOS shells only know about
                  the PATH in effect at the time they were
                  started.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Test. Try typing the
                  command:</p>
                  <pre>
Rgui<br />
</pre>

                  <p>in a new DOS shell. This should launch R with
                  the interface you are familiar with. Try, in R,
                  typing the command:</p>
                  <pre>
sessionInfo()<br />
</pre>

                  <p>This R was made today, and by you!
                  Congratulations!</p>
