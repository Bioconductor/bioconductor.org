            <p>This page describes how to install the software that
            will be used during the <a href="http://bioconductor.org/rforbioc">R for Bioinformatics
            Course</a>.</p>

            <p>The objective is to install the tools needed to
            develop R software packages. This is more complicated
            than just installing R, becasue as a developer, you
            need to be able to build packages and this requires an
            additional set of software tools.</p>
