description: The one-week intensive course Statistical Data Analysis
  for Genome-Scale Biology teaches statistical and computational
  analysis of multi-omics studies in biology and biomedicine. It
  covers the underlying theory and state of the art (the morning
  lectures) and practical hands-on exercises based on the R /
  Bioconductor environment (the afternoon labs). At the end of the
  course, you should be able to run analysis workflows on your own
  (multi-) omic data, adapt and combine different tools, and make
  informed and scientifically sound choices about analysis
  strategies. The course is intended for researchers who have basic
  familiarity with the experimental technologies and their
  applications in biology, and who are interested in making the step
  from a user of bioinformatics software towards adapting or
  developing their own analysis workflows. The four practical sessions
  of the course will require you to follow and modify scripts in the
  computer language R.
