# BioC 2017: Where Software and Biology Connect

July 27-28, 2017 (Developer Day: July 26)<br />
Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA<br />

This conference highlights current developments within and beyond
_Bioconductor_. Morning scientific talks and afternoon workshops
provide conference participants with insights and tools required for
the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic
data. 'Developer Day' precedes the main conference on July 26,
providing developers and would-be developers an opportunity to gain
insights into project direction and software development best
practices.

# Call for proposals

## Birds-of-a-feather

Due June 1

New this year! _Bioconductor_ builds and maintains communities with
interests in analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic
data. To that end, we introduce **Birds-of-a-Feather** (BOF) sessions
to provide an informal, non-commercial venue for attendees to discuss
current topics of mutual interest within the _Bioconductor_
community. BOF sessions place a strong emphasis on audience-driven
discussion, professional networking and grassroots participation. BOF
sessions are informal, and will be scheduled during lunch and other
social periods.

BOF applications that include ideas for development or education, or
address scientific questions at a community level are strongly
encouraged. We encourage BOF leaders to aim at synthesizing results in
a way that contributes to long-term community development (e.g., an
F1000Research review or _Bioconductor_ workflow; a working group
focusing on development and use of relevant software, etc.)

After the session, BOF leader willl submit a brief (<1 page) summary
of the BOF session, together with a roster of attendees.

[Apply to lead a BOF session][apply-bof].

## Workshops

Due: June 1

Workshops provide participants with excellent hands-on opportunities
to learn how to use _Bioconductor_ packages for rigorous statistical
analysis of genomic data. Workshops last for 1.5 hours and target
beginning and intermediate _R_ users. Workshop leaders will have
prepared course material in advance, typically as an _R_ /
_Bioconductor_ package containing a vignette with activities and
exercises to guide users through the material. _Bioconductor_ makes
the package and supporting material available on Amazon machine
instances during the conference. Participants connect to the AMI to
work through the material during the workshop.
