description: This one week intensive course will give insights into recent advances in statistical and computational aspects of the design and interpretation of genome-scale experiments. The topics will include all aspects of the data analysis of high-throughput sequencing for transcriptomics (RNA-Seq) and chromatin dynamics (ChIP-Seq). The course is intended for researchers with a basic understanding of these technologies and their associated statistical and computational challenges. The four practical sessions of the course will require basic programming in the language R.
