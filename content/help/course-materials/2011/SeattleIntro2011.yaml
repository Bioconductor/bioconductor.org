description: This course introduces participants to the use of R and Bioconductor for the analysis of high throughput sequence data. Participants are expected to have basic familiarity with R, and with relevant biological domains. Participants can expect to gain a better understanding of how R works, and of the ways in which Bioconductor represents and manipulates sequence data. Participants will gain experience in simple work flows for the analysis of common next-generation sequence experiments.
