            cerevisiae</b><br />
            <br />
            Naturally occurring sequence variation that affects
            gene expression is an important source of phenotypic
            differences among individuals within a species. We and
            others have previously shown that such regulatory
            variation can occur at the locus as the gene whose
            expression it affects, and elsewhere in the genome at
            trans-acting factors. Here we present a genome-wide
            analysis of local regulatory variation in Saccharomyces
            cerevisiae. We use genetic linkage analysis to show
            that a quarter of all yeast genes contain local
            regulatory variation between two divergent strains.
            Measurements of allele-specific expression in a diploid
            hybrid demonstrate that 50-80% of local regulatory
            polymorphisms affect transcript levels directly in cis,
            while the rest act in trans, presumably through
            feedback loops. Sequence analysis reveals that genes
            subject to local regulatory variation show increased
            polymorphism in the promoter regions, and that some but
            not all of this increase is due to polymorphisms in
            predicted transcription factor binding sites. Increased
            polymorphism is also found in the 3' untranslated
            regions of these genes, suggesting that there is a
            diverse set of mechanisms through which local variation
            can affect gene expression levels.
