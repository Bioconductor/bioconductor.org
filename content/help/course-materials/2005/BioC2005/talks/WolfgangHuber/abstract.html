                    <p><strong>Array of plenty - analysis of a 4
                    base resolution yeast genome tiling
                    array</strong></p>

                    <p>Conventional microarrays measure the
                    abundance of transcripts using a set of probes
                    whose sequence is designed on the basis of
                    prior knowledge about the transcriptome. More
                    recently, high resolution tiling microarrays
                    make it possible to probe for the whole
                    sequence content of a genome. This enables the
                    discovery of new, unexpected transcripts and
                    the observation of transcript structure,
                    including untranslated regions (UTRs) and
                    exon-intron structure. I will describe the
                    analysis of a yeast genome tiling array, on
                    which 6.5 Million probes of length 25 bases
                    each tile the complete genome of Saccharomyces
                    cerevisiae (12 Megabases) in steps of 4
                    bases.</p>

                    <p>One of the analytical challenges is that of
                    segmentation, or change point detection. A
                    typical yeast chromosome presents around
                    120,000 sample points, along which we expect
                    around 1000 change points (e.g. transcript
                    boundaries). I will describe a dynamic
                    programming algorithm which globally optimizes
                    the likelihood of a piecewise constant curve,
                    and discuss the model selection problem.</p>
