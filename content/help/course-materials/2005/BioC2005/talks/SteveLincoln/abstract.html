            Surveys indicate that Bioconductor has emerged as one
            of the most commonly used environments for the analysis
            and quality control of data from microarrays in
            general, and from Affymetrix GeneChips in specific. 
            Indeed Bioconductor is considered by most Affymetrix
            users to be both a proving ground and a gold standard
            for modern analysis methods. Of course, both current
            thinking in GeneChip data analysis, as well as the
            GeneChip technology itself, are rapidly evolving.<br />
            <br />
            Using emerging manufacturing and instrumentation
            technologies which scale down to 5 micron features,
            cartridges with over 6 million different probes, as
            well as 96-well plates with 150 million probes, can be
            reliably manufactured, hybridized and scanned.  In this
            very brief overview we will describe various new
            GeneChips which have be designed using these methods
            and will illustrate biomedical applications of these
            chips spanning the areas of gene expression, splice
            variant analysis, transcriptome analysis, genetic
            variation and copy number analysis.  We will also
            provide a brief introduction to changes being
            implemented in the Affymetrix instrumentation and
            software to better accommodate the size and complexity
            of these data.  These changes will also allow increased
            flexibility in analyzing GeneChip data using tools such
            as BioConductor.<br />
            <br />
            We hope that this quick discussion will prove useful to
            Bioconductor developers in planning their own projects
            and collaborations.  We also look forward to feedback
            from the Bioconductor community in all of these
            areas.<br />
