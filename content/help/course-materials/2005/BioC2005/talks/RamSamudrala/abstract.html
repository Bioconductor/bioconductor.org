            <p>A fundamental biological challenge is to understand
            how the linear information in an organism's genome is
            processed to produce the resulting behavior or
            phenotype. Genes are transcribed and translated into
            proteins that adopt three-dimensional conformations.
            Evolutionary processes ensure that a folded protein
            conformation interacts with its environment in a manner
            that is beneficial to the organism, using the protein
            to catalyze reactions, recognize cellular signals,
            build cellular structures, and to perform a host of
            other diverse biological functions.</p>

            <p>Our research aims to understand these processes by
            using computational techniques to perform sophisticated
            analyses on genomic sequence data to annotate and
            understand relationships between the sequence,
            structure, and function of DNA, RNA, proteins and
            metabolites, at both the molecular and the
            genomic/systems levels. The goal is to develop a
            coherent picture of molecular and organismal structure,
            function, networks, and evolution within a fundamental
            scientific framework. We have applied our methods to
            the genomes/proteomes of more than forty organisms,
            encapsulated by the object-oriented Bioverse database
            and webserver (<a href="http://bioverse.compbio.washington.edu/">http://bioverse.compbio.washington.edu</a>).
            The talk will detail our current progress and provide
            an overview of the methodologies being pursued by our
            group to achieve the above goals, as well as
            applications and discoveries made using this
            framework.</p>
