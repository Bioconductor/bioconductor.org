            <p><strong>Genome-wide views of Human
            Cancer</strong></p>

            <p>Cancer is a molecularly complex disease. The recent
            development of tools for the high-throughput analysis
            of molecular information therefore has revolutionized
            experimental approaches to cancer biology and medicine.
            We have used high-dimensional gene expression data from
            human tumors to gain insight into molecular
            determinants of cancer pathogenesis. These studies have
            suggested new approaches for the diagnosis and
            treatment of cancer patients.</p>
