            <p><strong>Genome-wide Approaches to Dissect Cellular
            Signaling by RNAi</strong></p>

            <p>An important aim upon completion of whole genome
            sequences is the functional analysis of all predicted
            gene products. Genetic approaches in the past have
            provided insights into requirement for gene products.
            New methods such as RNA interference (RNAi) allow
            silencing of specific genes on a genome-wide scale.</p>

            <p>We have developed an approach to rapidly screen all
            genes encoded by the Drosophila genome using
            genome-wide RNAi library. Drosophila is one of the
            best-studied genetic model systems and has been
            instrumental to the identification of conserved pathway
            components with important roles from flies to humans.
            Treatment of cultured Drosophila cells with dsRNA leads
            to the efficient depletion of the corresponding
            transcript and the generation of specific and penetrant
            phenotypes. We have applied a high-throughput RNAi
            screen in macrophage-like cells to characterize the
            function of nearly all predicted Drosophila gene in
            cell growth and viability and several signaling
            pathways. Quantitative analysis showed that mutant
            phenotypes allowed classification of phenotypes into
            distinct functional classes.</p>

            <p>The genome-wide RNAi library is adaptable for
            screening for many different cellular pathways and
            processes, which should ultimately facilitate the
            understanding of complex cellular networks. We will
            present results from genome-wide RNAi screens to
            comprehensively identify signaling pathway components
            and approaches to integrate data sets across different
            pathways.</p>
