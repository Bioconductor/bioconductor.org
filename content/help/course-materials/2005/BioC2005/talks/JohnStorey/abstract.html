            <p>Characterizing the genome-wide dynamic regulation of
            gene expression is important and will be of much
            interest in the future. Here I develop a significance
            method for analyzing time course microarray studies
            that can be applied to the typical types of comparisons
            and sampling schemes. This method is applied to two
            studies on humans. In one study, genes are identified
            that show differential expression over time in response
            to in vivo endotoxin administration. Using our method
            7409 genes are called significant at a 1% false
            discovery rate level, whereas several existing
            approaches fail to identify any genes. In another
            study, 417 genes are identified at a 10% false
            discovery rate level that show expression changing with
            age in the kidney cortex. Here it is also shown that as
            many as 47% of the genes change with age in a manner
            more complex than simple exponential growth or
            decay.</p>
