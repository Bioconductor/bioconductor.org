            <p>The standard analysis approach to the novel gene
            discovery in microarray data is emerging as one based
            on statistical significance and hypothesis testing for
            each gene's differential expression, with careful
            attention paid to multiple comparison issues. However,
            when only a small number of replicated arrays are
            available, these approaches can often be underpowered
            and inevitably result both in high false positive and
            false negative error rates due to their inaccurate
            within-gene error estimation.</p>

            <p>In this lab session, we introduce advanced error
            information integration methods to overcome such
            restrictions in small sample microarray data analysis.
            These are: local pooled error (LPE) method for testing
            two comparing conditions and empirical Bayes
            heterogeneous error model (HEM) for simultaneously
            identifying differentially expressed genes among
            multiple conditions in a microarray study, especially
            the latter a natural Bayesian extension of LPE to
            multiple-condition microarray data. With their
            resampling-based false discovery rate (FDR) evaluation
            designed for small sample microarray data, these
            approaches have been proven to significantly improve
            statistical discovery power in microarray data analysis
            with limited replication.</p>

            <p>We will guide their basic concepts and the use of
            these packages with several practical microarray data
            sets with step-by-step hands-on demonstrations that can
            be conveniently followed both by computational and
            biological researchers.</p>
