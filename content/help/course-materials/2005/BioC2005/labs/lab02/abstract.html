            <p>The lab will introduce the facilities in
            Bioconductor to use graphs to represent relationships,
            such as protein interactions or statistical dependency
            of events. It will demonstrate the RBGL package, which
            provides common graph-theoretical algorithms, and the
            display of graphs with Rgraphviz.</p>
