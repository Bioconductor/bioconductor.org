            <p><strong>V. Carey</strong><br /></p>This lab reviews
            basic concepts of supervised statistical learning
            methods, including outcome and feature representation,
            distance measures, families of learning procedures and
            their tuning parameters, doubt and outlier decisions,
            generalization error bounds and estimation.
            Applications of machine learning procedures to
            microarray data are presented using the Bioconductor
            MLInterfaces package. Applications will involve
            mechanical prediction tasks and substantive
            interpretation via feature importance measurement.
