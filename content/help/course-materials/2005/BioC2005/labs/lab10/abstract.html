            <p>Ongoing technology developments have enabled the
            tiling of over 6 million probes on a single Affymetrix
            oligo microarray. This technology push has enabled the
            development of commercial whole genome exon and tiling
            arrays. Current exon microarray implementations consist
            of a single microarray covering roughly 1 million exons
            with 1.4 million probesets consisting of 4 perfect
            match probes per probeset; tiling array implementations
            consist of tiling either a perfect match probe (for 7
            chip set) or a perfect match and mismatch probe (for 14
            chip set) every 35 bases across the entire genome.
            These product concepts are being applied for human and
            mouse with other organisms to follow.</p>
