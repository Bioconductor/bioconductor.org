            <p>In this session, the participants will be introduced
            to the msInspect analysis package and learn to use it
            for processing high resolution LC-MS data, including
            image processing, peptide feature detection,
            normalization of spectra, and alignment of LC-MS
            features accrosss multiple runs.</p>

            <p>Clustering analysis tools based on the R statistical
            package will be used for normalization and clustering.
            The algorithms will be demonstrated using data of
            increasingly complex biological samples; bacteria,
            yeast, and human serum. The hands-on use of msInspect
            will be distributed to the participants along with some
            example data files.</p>

            <p>By the end of the sesssion, the participants should
            be capable of processing the data, but will also obtain
            knowlegde about proitein fingerprinting, the
            underpinning's of LC-MS mass spectrometry, and the
            basic biochemistry needed to understand and interpret
            the data analysis package.</p>
