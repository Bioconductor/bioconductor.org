            analysis with metadata from biological databases

            <p>biomaRt is a new Bioconductor package that
            integrates BioMart data resources such as Ensembl, with
            data analysis in Bioconductor. It can be used to
            annotate a wide range of gene or gene product
            identifiers (e.g. Affymetrix, Entrez-Gene, ... ) with
            information such as gene symbol, chromosomal
            coordinates, GO and OMIM. Beside it's use for
            annotation, biomaRt can retrieve a wealth of other
            information e.g. genomic sequences, SNP information and
            homologs. Fast and up-to-date data retrieval is
            possible as biomaRt executes direct SQL queries to the
            BioMarts. This tight integration of biological
            databases with data analysis in Bioconductor provides a
            powerful platform for biological data mining.<br /></p>

            <p>BioC has various means of accessing public genomic
            data sources. Topics covered include a survey of BioC's
            metadata and its usage, building annotation data
            packages, accessing GEO, KEGG, and TIGR data within R
            using various BioC functions. Attendants are encouraged
            to bring their own data for annotation purpose.</p>
