            <p>S+ArrayAnalyzer is a microarray data analysis
            software solution developed in collaboration with
            BioConductor package developers and deployed with
            S-PLUS and S-PLUS Server. It includes methods for data
            access, probe-level summary, QA/diagnostics, filtering,
            normalization, differential expression testing, class
            discovery, class prediction, machine learning,
            annotation and gene list management. Analysis results
            are reported using S+Graphlets, lightweight web applets
            that include local drilldown and zoom, and connection
            to metadata on mouseover and click. S+ArrayAnalyzer is
            extendable using S-PLUS scripts, and (well-documented)
            C++, Java, SOAP, JavaServer Pages Tag API's.
            S+ArrayAnalyzer runs on Windows, Linux, and Solaris and
            includes web (server) and desktop deployment
            options.</p>

            <p>This workshop covers worked examples on (a)
            differential expression (probe-level analysis,
            filtering (e.g. with GO terms), linear modeling, gene
            list management and annotation) using time course and
            2-factor designs; and, as time permits (b) analysis of
            clinical and expression data for identification of
            biomarkers using resampled Cox regression and machine
            learning methods.</p>

            <p>The workshop will be run using S+ArrayAnalyzer on
            Windows; attendees are encouraged to bring a Windows
            laptop with as much RAM as possible.</p>
