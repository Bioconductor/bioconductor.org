            A 2x2 factorial experiment</h1>

            <p>Gordon Smyth<br />
            16 August 2005</p>

            <h2>1. Aims</h2>

            <p>This case study illustrates more advanced linear
            modeling with Affymetrix single-channel microarrays.
            The popular 2x2 factorial design is considered. Use of
            Bioconductor annotation for Affymetrix arrays is
            illustrated. The case study goes on to consider
            significance tests using <i>gene sets</i>.</p>

            <h2>2. Required data</h2>

            <p>The estrogen data set is required for this lab and
            can be obtained from <a href="../Data/estrogen.zip">estrogen.zip</a>. You should
            create a clean directory, unpack this file into that
            directory, then set that directory as your working
            directory for your R session using setwd() or
            otherwise. By typing dir() you should see eight .CEL
            files and three text files. On my computer, I see:</p>
            <pre>
&gt; setwd("C:/Gordon/www/bioinf/marray/bioc2005/_src/estrogen")
&gt; dir()
 [1] "estrogen.txt"         "high10-1.cel"         "high10-2.cel"        
 [4] "high48-1.cel"         "high48-2.cel"         "knownERgenes.txt"    
 [7] "low10-1.cel"          "low10-2.cel"          "low48-1.cel"         
[10] "low48-2.cel"          "predictedERgenes.txt"
</pre>

            <p>To repeat this case study in full you will need to
            have the R packages affy, hgu95av2cdf, hgu95av2 and
            xtable installed.</p>

            <h2>3. Estrogen experiment</h2>

            <p>The data gives results from a 2x2 factorial
            experiment on MCF7 breast cancer cells using Affymetrix
            HGU95av2 arrays. The factors in this experiment were
            estrogen (present or absent) and length of exposure (10
            or 48 hours). The aim of the study is the identify
            genes which respond to estrogen and to classify these
            into early and late responders. Genes which respond
            early are putative direct-target genes while those
            which respond late are probably downstream targets in
            the molecular pathway.</p>

            <p>This data is from the estrogen data package on the
            Bioconductor website <a href="http://bioconductor.org/data/experimental.html">http://bioconductor.org/data/experimental.html</a>.
            Rather than loading the data package here we simply
            using the nine basic data files from that package, in
            order to save storage space and to more closely mimic a
            real data analysis situation. The data set is discussed
            further by Scholtens [1,2] and in the Limma User's
            Guide.</p>

            <h2>4. Read the data</h2>

            <p>The first step in most analyses is to read the
            targets file which describes what RNA target has been
            hybridized to each array and, equally importantly,
            gives the names of the corresponding data files. The
            targets file is usually tab-delimited, but here it is
            white-space delimited.</p>
            <pre>
 library(limma)
 targets &lt;- readTargets("estrogen.txt", sep="")
 targets
</pre>

            <p>You should see</p>
            <pre>
&gt; targets
      filename estrogen time.h
1  low10-1.cel   absent     10
2  low10-2.cel   absent     10
3 high10-1.cel  present     10
4 high10-2.cel  present     10
5  low48-1.cel   absent     48
6  low48-2.cel   absent     48
7 high48-1.cel  present     48
8 high48-2.cel  present     48
</pre>

            <p>Now read the CEL file data into an AffyBatch object
            and normalize using RMA:</p>
            <pre>
 library(affy)
 library(hgu95av2cdf)
 abatch &lt;- ReadAffy(filenames=targets$filename)
 eset &lt;- rma(abatch)
</pre>

            <p>Here eset is a data object of class exprSet.</p>

            <p>It is usual and appropriate to check data quality
            before continuing your analysis. Due to brevity we will
            skip over this in this lab. A full set of quality
            assessment plots can be found at <a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bolstad/PLMImageGallery/">
            http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bolstad/PLMImageGallery/</a>
            under the title "estrogen". These plots show no
            significant quality problems with any arrays in this
            dataset.</p>

            <h2>5. Create a design matrix</h2>

            <p>We have four pairs of replicate arrays so we should
            estimate four parameters in the linear model. There are
            many valid ways to choose a design matrix, but perhaps
            the simplest is to make each column correspond to a
            particular treatment combination:.</p><img src="../images-apoest/estrogenDesignMatrix.png" alt="estrogenDesignMatrix.png" /><br />

            <p>The four columns of the matrix correspond to
            <code>absent10</code>, <code>present10</code>,
            <code>absent48</code> and <code>present48</code>,
            respectively. Another way to specify the design matrix
            is described in the Limma User's Guide.</p>

            <p>This design matrix given above can be computed in R
            as follows:</p>
            <pre>
 f &lt;- paste(targets$estrogen,targets$time.h,sep="")
 f &lt;- factor(f)
 f
 design &lt;- model.matrix(~0+f)
 colnames(design) &lt;- levels(f)
 design
</pre>

            <h2>6. Fit the linear model</h2>

            <p>Now that we have defined our design matrix, fitting
            a linear model is as simple as:</p>
            <pre>
 fit &lt;- lmFit(eset, design)
</pre>

            <p><code>fit</code> is an object of class
            <code>MArrayLM</code>.</p>
            <pre>
 names(fit)
</pre>

            <p>The fitted coefficents fit$coef from the model fit
            are just the mean log-expression for each treatment
            combination for each probe set. For this reason, this
            choice of design matrix is called the <i>group means
            parametrization</i> in the Limma User's
            Guide.<br /></p>

            <h2>7. Define a contrast matrix</h2>

            <p>The idea now is to use contrasts to make any
            comparisons of interest between the four treatment
            combination. Contrasts are linear combinations of
            parameters from the linear model fit.</p><img src="../images-apoest/Contrasts.png" alt="Contrasts.png" /><br />

            <p>where <img src="../images-apoest/beta.png" align="middle" alt="beta.png" /> is a vector of contrasts
            for gene <img src="../images-apoest/g.png" align="bottom" alt="g.png" />, <img src="../images-apoest/C.png" align="bottom" alt="C.png" /> is the contrasts matrix, and
            <img src="../images-apoest/alpha.png" align="middle" alt="alpha.png" /> is a vector of coefficients
            (estimated log fold changes), obtained from a linear
            model fit.</p>

            <p>We will estimate three contrasts (so our contrasts
            matrix will have three columns). The first contrast is
            an estrogen effect at time 10 hours, the second as an
            estrogen effect at time 48 hours and the third is the
            time effect in the absence of estrogen. These are not
            all the comparisons which might have been
            made.</p><img src="../images-apoest/estrogenContrastsMatrix.png" alt="estrogenContrastsMatrix.png" /><br />
            <pre>
 cont.matrix &lt;- makeContrasts(E10="present10-absent10",E48="present48-absent48",Time="absent48-absent10",levels=design)
 cont.matrix
</pre>

            <h2>8. Extract the linear model fit for the
            contrasts</h2>
            <pre>
 fit2  &lt;- contrasts.fit(fit, cont.matrix)
 fit2  &lt;- eBayes(fit2)
</pre>

            <h2>9. Assessing differential expression</h2>

            <p>We now use the function <code>topTable</code> to
            obtain a list genes differentially expressed between
            Estrogen-Present and Estrogen-Absent at time 10 hours,
            followed by a list of genes differentially expressed
            between Estrogen-Present and Estrogen-Absent at time 48
            hours.</p>
            <pre>
 colnames(fit2)
 topTable(fit2,coef=1)
 topTable(fit2,coef=2,adjust="fdr")
 topTable(fit2,coef=2)
 topTable(fit2,coef=2,adjust="fdr")
</pre>

            <p>The function decideTests() provides a variety of
            ways to assign statistical significance to the
            contrasts while controlling for multiple testing.</p>

            <h2>10. Linking the gene lists to annotation
            information on the Internet</h2>

            <p>This section was prepared by James Wettenhall.</p>

            <p>If the genes int the topTable have standard IDs
            (e.g. UniGene or GenBank), then they can be linked with
            external annotation information on the Internet. Load
            the annotation package <code>hgu95av2</code>, which can
            be obtained from <a href="http://bioconductor.org/data/metaData.html">http://bioconductor.org/data/metaData.html</a>.</p>
            <pre>
 library(hgu95av2cdf)
 library(hgu95av2)
</pre>

            <p>Now we obtain:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>the gene (probe-set) IDs (from the
              <code>AffyBatch</code> object, <code>ab</code>),</li>

              <li>the gene symbols (from the
              <code>hgu95av2SYMBOL</code> environment in the
              <code>hgu95av2</code> annotation package),</li>

              <li>the gene names (from the
              <code><code>hgu95av2</code>GENENAME</code>
              environment in the <code>hgu95av2</code> annotation
              package), and</li>

              <li>the UniGene IDs (from the
              <code><code>hgu95av2</code>UNIGENE</code> environment
              in the <code>hgu95av2</code> annotation
              package).</li>
            </ul>
            <pre>
 geneIDs &lt;- ls(hgu95av2cdf)
</pre>

            <p>It is possible to extract the annotation information
            from the appropriate R environments within the
            annotation package (<code>hgu95av2</code>), and store
            it in simple R data structures as follows:</p>
            <pre>
 # geneSymbols &lt;- unlist(as.list(hgu95av2SYMBOL))
 # geneNames &lt;- unlist(as.list(hgu95av2GENENAME))
 # unigene &lt;- unlist(as.list(hgu95av2UNIGENE))
</pre>

            <p>However we must be very careful, because in recent
            versions of Bioconductor annotation packages, some gene
            IDs can map to multiple gene names, multiple symbols
            and/or multiple unigene clusters. The method above,
            while appearing simple, also does not allow for the
            possibility that the gene names are stored in a
            different order in the annotation package from the gene
            IDs. We will therefore use some rather
            complicated-looking R code to extract the gene symbols,
            names and unigene IDs from the hgu95av2 environment.
            Multiple entries will be collapsed and separated by
            semicolons, e.g. if geneID 001 corresponds to gene
            names "Name1" and "Name2", these will be collapsed into
            "Name1; Name2".</p>
            <pre>
 geneSymbols &lt;- as.character(unlist(lapply(mget(geneIDs,env=hgu95av2SYMBOL),
     function (symbol) { return(paste(symbol,collapse="; ")) } )))
 geneNames &lt;- as.character(unlist(lapply(mget(geneIDs,env=hgu95av2GENENAME),
     function (name) { return(paste(name,collapse="; ")) } )))
 unigene &lt;- as.character(unlist(lapply(mget(geneIDs,env=hgu95av2UNIGENE),
     function (unigeneID) { return(paste(unigeneID,collapse="; ")) } )))
</pre>

            <p>The key functions to note in the code above are
            <code>mget</code> which extracts multiple annotation
            strings from the appropriate annotation environmentand
            <code>lapply</code> which applies our
            multiple-entry-collapsing function to every element in
            a list of annotation strings.</p>

            <p>Now we abbreviate the gene names to a maximum length
            of 40 characters, for neat formatting in a table, and
            we extract the unigene ID from the string which
            contains "Hs" (for Homo sapiens) as well as the unigene
            ID.</p>
            <pre>
 geneNames &lt;- substring(geneNames,1,40)
 unigene &lt;- gsub("Hs\\.","",unigene)

   unigene,"&gt;",unigene,"&lt;/a&gt;",sep=""))
</pre>

            <p>Now we recreate the toptable for the two contrasts
            considered earlier, E10="present10-absent10" and
            E48="present48-absent48" this time providing a
            hyperlink to the UniGene website for each gene in the
            toptable.</p>

            <h2>11. Gene Set Enrichment</h2>

            <p>This section was prepared by James Wettenhall.</p>

            <h3>11.1 Introduction to Gene Set Analysis</h3>

            <p>In this lab, we move beyond the analysis of
            individual genes, and consider sets of genes in
            microarray experiments. Another approach is to form
            gene sets based on a priori knowledge of common
            biological features shared by the genes. We consider a
            particular approach called gene set enrichment. We
            begin with a known set of genes and then test whether
            this set as a whole is differentially expressed in a
            microarray experiment. This type of test is useful when
            comparing one's microarray data with that of previous
            authors who have performed similar microarray
            experiments, because the lists of most differentially
            expressed genes reported by the previous authors can be
            regarded as a "gene set" and tested to determine
            whether the genes are also differentially expressed in
            the current context.</p>

            <p>Gene set testing was introduced by Mootha et al [5]
            and Lamb et al [6] in 2003. Mootha et al define the
            concept of a gene set enrichment test. For a given set
            of genes, one can test whether the set as a whole is
            up-regulated, down-regulated or differentially
            expressed with individual genes possibly going in
            either direction. Sometimes performing the traditional
            differential expression analysis of individual genes
            will yield no statistically significant results, but
            there may be stronger evidence for differential
            expression of gene sets.</p>

            <p>Now we turn our attention to tests for differential
            expression involving a set of genes. Mootha et al. [5]
            and Lamb et al. [6] made this methods popular in 2003.
            We will use a "gene set enrichment test", which is
            closely based on the one defined by Mootha et al. The
            gene set test can be used to test whether previous
            author's lists of differentially expressed genes are
            also differentially expressed in a current experiment
            similar to that of the previous authors. Another
            possible application is to try to find differential
            expression in microarray experiments which show no
            strong differential expression when testing for
            individual differentially expressed genes, but they
            might show more evidence of differential expression
            when testing a predefined set of genes. Defining a
            useful gene set for this sort of analysis is not always
            trivial. One possibility is to use a set of genes which
            share common gene ontologies, i.e. choose a set of
            genes which are all associated with GOs below a certain
            node in the GO DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). We will
            begin with some artificial examples to illustrate the
            concept of gene set tests with a small number of
            made-up t-statistics. Then we will use two sets of
            genes thought to be regulated by the Estrogen Receptor
            (ERalpha) to demonstrate testing for differential
            expression of gene sets in the Estrogen data set.</p>

            <p>The <code>geneSetTest</code> function in the limma
            package [8] is described in its help file, reproduced
            below:</p>

            <div>
              This is essentially a stream-lined approach to Gene
              Set Enrichment Analysis introduced by Mootha et al
              (2003). Usually, 'statistics' is intended to hold
              t-like statistics, meaning that the genewise null
              hypotheses would be rejected for large positive or
              large negative values. Then 'alternative="greater"'
              can be used to test whether genes in the set tend to
              be up-regulated, 'alternative="less"' can be used to
              test whether the gene set is down-regulated, while
              'alternative="two.sided"' tests whether the gene set
              holds highly ranked genes without regard to direction
              of change. Important note: if 'statistics' is an
              F-like statistic for which only large values are
              relevant for rejecting the null hypothesis, then you
              must use 'alternative="greater"' to get meaningful
              results.
            </div>

            <p>We now demonstrate the use of the
            <code>geneSetTest</code> function in <code>limma</code>
            using a miniscule set of artifical made-up
            t-statistics, where as usual, a positive t statistic
            means that a gene is up-regulated (i.e. expressed more
            highly in a condition of interest), whilst a negative
            value means that the gene is down-regulated. A
            t-statistic close to zero means that the gene is not
            differentially expressed.</p>

            <p>In the first example we use, the artificial
            t-statistics will range from -9 to 9, and we will
            select a set of three genes for the test, those with
            t-statistics of -8, -6 and -5, i.e. we will use the
            2nd, 4th and 5th t-statistics from our vector of
            artificial t-statistics. If these t-statistics
            represented real genes, all three genes would show
            strong evidence of differential expression
            (down-regulation) individually, so they should
            certainly show strong evidence of differential
            expression as a set as well. The value returned by
            limma's <code>geneSetTest</code> function is a
            p-value.</p>
            <pre>
 library(limma)
 sel &lt;- c(2,4,5)
 stat &lt;- -9:9
 stat[sel]
 geneSetTest(sel,stat,nsim=100)
 geneSetTest(sel,stat,ranks.only=TRUE)
</pre>

            <p>If we did a test for up-regulation of the set, we
            would expect a large p-value (low evidence of
            up-regulation):</p>
            <pre>
 geneSetTest(sel,stat,alternative="greater",nsim=100)
</pre>

            <p>On the otherhand, a test for down-regulation should
            give a small p-value:</p>
            <pre>
 geneSetTest(sel,stat,alternative="less",nsim=100)
</pre>

            <h3>11.2 Gene Set Analysis Example</h3>

            <p>We will again use the Estrogen data set through the
            <code>fit2</code> linear model fit object.</p>

            <p>We will use two sets of genes which are thought to
            be ER-regulated, i.e. regulated by the Estrogen
            Receptor alpha. The first set (Jin et al [4]) contains
            genes which have been experimentally verified to be
            ER-regulated and the second set (O'lone et al [7])
            contains a large list of genes which are predicted to
            be ER-regulated by a model (so they may or may not be
            ER-regulated).</p>

            <p>These gene sets (particularly the first one) should
            be differentially expressed between the breast cancer
            cells with estrogen reintroduced and the serum-starved
            breast cancer cells with no estrogen, because in the
            cells reintroduced to estrogen, the estrogen receptors
            (ERs) will bind the estrogen and as a result become
            activated, gaining the ability to regulate gene
            expression in the cells, hence resulting in
            differential expression between the cells with and
            without estrogen.</p>

            <p>The data required for this exercise is available
            from knownERgenes.txt and predictedERgenes.txt. Read
            the gene lists into R:</p>
            <pre>
 known &lt;- read.delim("knownERgenes.txt",as.is=TRUE)
 knownERgenes &lt;- known$UGCluster
 predicted &lt;- read.delim("predictedERgenes.txt",as.is=TRUE)
 predictedERgenes &lt;- predicted$UGCluster
 library(hgu95av2)
 unigene &lt;- unlist(as.list(hgu95av2UNIGENE))
 knownERgenesOnChip &lt;- match(knownERgenes,unigene)
 knownERgenesOnChip &lt;- knownERgenesOnChip[!is.na(knownERgenesOnChip)]
 predictedERgenesOnChip &lt;- match(predictedERgenes,unigene)
 predictedERgenesOnChip &lt;- predictedERgenesOnChip[!is.na(predictedERgenesOnChip)]
</pre>

            <p>Now we will use the moderated t-statistics
            calculated previously for the comparison of estrogen
            present and estrogen absent 10 hours after the estrogen
            was reintroduced into the cells. We try all three types
            of tests - "two-sided", "greater" (for genes
            up-regulated in the sample with estrogen present), and
            "less" (for genes down-regulated in the sample with
            estrogen present). We expect to get better (smaller)
            p-values for the known ER-regulated genes than for the
            predicted ER-regulated genes. The recent review of
            Estrogen-repressed genes in breast cancer cells by
            Zubairy and Oesterreich [9] suggests that the majority
            of genes regulated by estrogen receptors are actually
            repressed (down-regulated), so we should expect a lower
            p-value for the "less" test (at least for the known
            ER-regulated genes).</p>
            <pre>
