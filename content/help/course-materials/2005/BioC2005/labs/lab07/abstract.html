            <p>In this session I will describe one of the most
            popular Bioconductor tools: the packages for
            preprocessing Affymetrix GeneChip arrays. Specifically
            we will show how to access and manipulate PM and MM
            data, explain and implement some of the most popular
            preprocessing algorithms, and perform some quaility
            assessment with the affyPLM package.<br /></p>

            <p>Producing a list of differentially expressed genes
            is only the first half of a microarray analysis. For
            this list to be truly useful, the genes must be
            annotated in some way and presented in a clear and
            usable format.</p>

            <p>In this tutorial we will explore various methods
            available in Bioconductor packages to append useful
            information to a list of genes and output in various
            formats (HTML tables, text files, pdf documents). In
            addition, we will discuss small 'wrapper' functions
            that can be used to simplify and/or automate the
            production of these documents. We will focus primarily
            on Affymetrix data, but many of the techniques are
            directly applicable to spotted cDNA as well as other
            oligonucleotide microarray platforms.</p>
