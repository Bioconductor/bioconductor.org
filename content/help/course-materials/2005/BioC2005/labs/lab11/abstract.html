            <p>Version 5 of Rosetta Resolver(r) gene expression
            data analysis system by Rosetta Biosoftware introduced
            a new feature which allows users to integrate R scripts
            into the Resolver system. This functionality allows
            users to extend the Resolver system's data processing
            and analysis using their internally-developed R
            programs or those in the public domain (e.g.,
            Bioconductor packages). We will discuss details of the
            R-Resolver system integration and present examples
            demonstrating the use of a user's R code (including
            Bioconductor packages) in the Resolver system's data
            analysis. Interested attendees will also have a
            hands-on opportunity to practice integrating R scripts
            into the Resolver system at this session.</p>
