description: This one week intensive course is intended to give insights into recent advances in statistical and computational aspects of the design and interpretation of microarray experiments. The topics will include all aspects of the data analysis of microarray experiments for transcript profiling and ChIP-chip. The course is intended mainly for researchers with a basic understanding of microarray technology and its statistical and computational challenges. The four practical sessions of the course will be most beneficial for participants that are able to converse in a programming language such as R.
