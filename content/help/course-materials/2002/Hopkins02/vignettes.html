            <p>Each Bioconductor package contains at least one
            vignette, a document that provides a task-oriented
            description of package functionality. Vignettes contain
            executable examples and are intended to be used
            interactively.</p>

            <p>You can access the PDF version of a vignette for any
            installed package from inside R as follows:</p>
            <pre>
library("Biobase")<br />
## now load package of interset, here GOstats<br />
library("GOstats")<br />
openVignette()<br />
</pre>

            <p>This will present you with a menu where you can
            select the desired vignette. Selecting a vignette
            should cause the corresponding PDF file to open on your
            system.</p>

            <p>The vignette files, both the PDF and the Rnw sources
            document, are located in the <code>doc</code> directory
            of an installed package (inst/doc for an uninstalled
            package tarball). You can discover the location of an
            installed package as follows:</p>
            <pre>
system.file(package = "GOstats")<br />
</pre>

            <p>You can extract all of the R code from a vignette
            source file (these files are in Sweave format) as shown
            below. The result will be a <code>.R</code> file for
            each vignette source file written to your current
            working directory. You can use these R files to cut and
            paste into an R session so that you can work the
            examples in the vignette yourself.</p>
            <pre>
library("tools")<br />
vigSrc = list.files(pattern = "Rnw$",<br />
                    system.file("doc", package = "GOstats"),<br />
                    full.names = TRUE)<br />
vigSrc<br />
for (v in vigSrc) Stangle(v)<br />
</pre>

            <p>You can also download the vignette for a package
            that isn't installed on your system. Package vignettes
            are linked from each package's description page which
            can be reached from the <a href="/packages/release/BiocViews.html">
            BiocViews</a> page.</p><br />
            <br />

            <p><b>Term of use for the vignettes:</b> You are
            welcome to use these materials for instructional
            purposes. However, you may not include these in
            separately published works (articles, books,
            websites).When using all or parts of the Bioconductor
            course materials (slides, vignettes, scripts) we would
            appreciate it if you would cite the authors and refer
            your audience to the Bioconductor website</p>
