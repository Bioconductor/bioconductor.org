                <p>This list is for discussions about the active
                and future development of <em>Bioconductor</em>,
                and pre-testing of new versions. It is meant for
                those who maintain active positions in the
                development of <em>Bioconductor</em> (members of
                Biocore and developers of contributed packages) as
                well as others who have an interest in keeping up
                to date with these matters.</p>

                <p>This list is for discussion and development of
                <em>Bioconductor</em> packages for analysis of
                ultra-high throughput sequencing data. Ultra-high
                throughput data comes from Solexa, 454, and other
                similar technologies. The SIG focuses on
                development, but welcomes input from users facing
                statistical, analytic or other challenges that
                require a package-level solution.</p>
