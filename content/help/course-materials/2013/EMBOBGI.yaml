description: This international advanced course will provide training on bioinformatics
  and statistics methods for genomic research. It will give insight into how biological
  knowledge can be generated from high-throughput sequencing (DNA-Seq, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq)
  experiments and will illustrate how to analyze such data. The course covers both
  the underlying statistical and algorithmic concepts, and the practice of how to
  automate and code such analyses using the scripting language R.  The course will
  be a mix of lectures and hands-on training. Practicals will consist of computer
  exercises that will enable the participants to apply statistical methods to the
  analysis of data under the guidance of the lecturers and teaching assistants. The
  EMBO Practical course will also teach the basics of the R/Bioconductor environment
  for statistical-bioinformatic data analysis.  The course is aimed at PhD students,
  postdocs and interested faculty. The teaching language will be English. Basic experience
  in computer programming (writing scripts) is required.
