title: Computational Statistics for Genome Biology (CSAMA)
description: This one-week intensive course teaches current
  approaches in the statistical and computational analysis of
  large-scale experiments in biology. The course focus on the methods
  for downstream analysis of high-throughput sequencing experiments,
  including DNA sequencing (variant calling), RNA sequencing
  (differential expression), QTL analysis, epigenetics. Lectures also
  cover essentials including statistical testing, machine learning,
  visualisation and bioinformatic metadata integration. The course is
  intended for researchers who have a basic familiarity with the
  experimental technologies and the biology of the genome. The four
  practical sessions of the course will require simple programming in
  the language R; introductory and advanced language tutorials will be
  provided.
