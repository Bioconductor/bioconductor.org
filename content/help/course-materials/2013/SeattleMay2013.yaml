title: Intermediate R / Bioconductor for High-Throughput Sequence Analysis
autogenerated: true
description: Intermediate R / Bioconductor for High-Throughput
  Sequence Analysis introduces users with some R experience to common
  Bioconductor work flows for sequence analysis. The course involves a
  combination of presentations and hands-on exercises. Our starting
  point is BAM files created by aligning short reads to a reference
  genome. Topics include exploratory analysis (GenomicRanges,
  Rsamtools); assessing differential expression of known genes
  (DESeq); detection, calling, and manipulation of variants
  (VariantTools, VariantAnnotation). We learn how to integrate results
  with curated gene and genomic annotations (GenomicFeatures), and to
  visualize results (GViz, ggbio).
