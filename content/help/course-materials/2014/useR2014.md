To be presented during [_useR! 2014_](http://user2014.stat.ucla.edu/).

### Goals

- Gain overall familiarity with _Bioconductor_ packages for
  high-throughput sequence analysis, including _Bioconductor_ vignettes
  and classes.
- Obtain experience running bioninformatic work flows for data quality
  assessment, RNA-seq differential expression, and manipulating
  variant call format files
- Appreciate the importance of ranges and range-based manipulation for
  modern genomic analysis
- Learn 'best practices' for working with large data
- Key packages:
  [Biostrings](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biostrings.html),
  [ShortRead](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ShortRead.html),
  [GenomicRanges](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GenomicRanges.html),
  [GenomicAlignments](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GenomicAlignments.html),
  [DESeq2](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html),
  and
  [VariantAnnotation](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/VariantAnnotation.html).


### Outline

- Introduction to _Bioconductor_ -- packages and classes
- Short work flows
  - Exploring sequences and alignments
  - RNA-seq: a high-level tour
  - Annotating variants

### Prerequisites

The workshop assumes an intermediate level of familiarity with _R_,
and basic understanding of biological and technological aspects of
high-throughput sequence analysis. Participants should come prepared
with a modern wireless-enabled laptop and web browser installed.
(Please have Firefox, Chrome, or Safari installed, as RStudio Server
does not work with Internet Explorer.)

### Intended Audience

This workshop is for professional bioinformaticians and statisticians
intending to use _R_ / _Bioconductor_ for analysis and comprehension
of high-throughput sequence data.
