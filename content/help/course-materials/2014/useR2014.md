To be presented during [_useR! 2014_](http://user2014.stat.ucla.edu/).

### Goals

- Gain overall familiarity with _Bioconductor_ packages for
  high-throughput sequence analysis, including _Bioconductor_ vignettes
  and classes.
- Obtain experience running bioninformatic work flows for data quality
  assessment, RNA-seq differential expression, and manipulating
  variant call format files
- Appreciate the importance of ranges and range-based manipulation for
  modern genomic analysis
- Learn 'best practices' for working with large data
- Key packages:
  [Biostrings](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biostrings.html),
  [ShortRead](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ShortRead.html),
  [GenomicRanges](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GenomicRanges.html),
  [GenomicAlignments](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GenomicAlignments.html),
  [DESeq2](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html),
  and
  [VariantAnnotation](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/VariantAnnotation.html).


### Outline

- Introduction to _Bioconductor_ -- packages and classes
- Short work flows
  - Exploring sequences and alignments
  - RNA-seq: a high-level tour
  - Annotating variants

### Prerequisites

The workshop assumes an intermediate level of familiarity with _R_,
and basic understanding of biological and technological aspects of
high-throughput sequence analysis. Participants should come prepared
with a modern wireless-enabled laptop and web browser installed.
(Please have Firefox, Chrome, or Safari installed, as RStudio Server
does not work with Internet Explorer.)

### Intended Audience

This workshop is for professional bioinformaticians and statisticians
intending to use _R_ / _Bioconductor_ for analysis and comprehension
of high-throughput sequence data.

### Course Materials

* [HTML](Introduction.html) [R](Introduction.R) Introduction
* [HTML](DataRepresentation.html) [R](DataRepresentation.R) Data Representation
* [HTML](Workflows.html) [R](Workflows.R) Work flows: RNASeq
* [HTML](Integration.html) [R](Integration.R) Annotation

### Amazon AMIs

To simplify working with these packages, we've created an Amazon
Machine Instance with the course material and RStudio installed, and
have provided instances for you.
 
Please Note:

1. Please use a modern web broswer (Chrome, Firefox; Internet Explorer
   is NOT compatible with RStudio)
3. Please use only the url assigned to you. If you log into someone
   else's, both of you will be signed out.
4. This AMI will be availiable only for class; the course material
   will be available after the class.

For those indicating that they would take the coure, the AMI's are as
follows. The 4-letter key is the first initial and last three letters
of your name.
