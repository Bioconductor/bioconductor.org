description: Introduction to Bioconductor for Sequence Analysis introduces users with
  some R experience to Bioconductor, especially working with high-throughput sequence
  data. Day 1 develops core R and Bioconductor concepts for working with large and
  complicated data. Participants will become familiar with data classes, packages,
  and scripting and programming concepts that are important for common and integrated
  work flows in Bioconductor. Day 2 will put these skills to use for the analysis
  of RNAseq differential expression data, including initial quality assessment, pre-processing,
  differential representation, annotation, and visualization. The course involves
  a combination of presentations and hands-on exercises; participants should come
  prepared with a modern laptop with wireless internet access.
