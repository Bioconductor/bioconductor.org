description: The Bioconductor project is a leading development and analysis environment
  for bioinformatics, supported by a core of dedicated programmers and a broad contributing
  scientific community.  The project is evolving rapidly along with sequencing technologies
  and the quantity of available genome annotation, and this workshop provides ISMB
  attendees with the inside track on the most recent and upcoming trends in Bioconductor.
  The workshop will begin with a high-level tour of leading Bioconductor packages
  and capabilities across a wide variety of disciplines, then will cover current advances
  for 1) accessing genomic annotation data such as ENCODE and the UCSC genome browser
  through the AnnotationHub architecture, 2) data and algorithm element designs for
  integrative analysis of large genomic data and annotation that permit scalable resource
  utilization at run-time, and 3) analysis of RNA-seq data.  The workshop features
  the project leader Martin Morgan, co-founders and Core member Vince Carey, Advisory
  Board member Levi Waldron, and post-doctoral fellow Michael Love (Rafael Irizarry
  lab).  This workshop is intended for a wide audience and will be valuable for beginner
  to experienced analysts of genomic data.
