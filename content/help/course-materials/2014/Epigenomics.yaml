description: Brazilian 2014 Cancer Epigenomics Workshop is an international forum
  of world renowned scientists in the area of cancer epigenomics and bioinformatics.  In
  collaboration with the 60th Society of Brazilian Genetics Congress and the Latin
  American Bioconductor Foundation, we have put together a series of talks and hands-on
  training. The workshop will include high-level science talks plus a short course
  on bioinformatics using open source statistical tool - [R](http://cran.r-project.org)
  and [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org) to analyze large-scale
  biological data. Bioconductor is a community driven platform, devoted to providing
  resources (via packages) for molecular biologist, computational biologist and bioinformatician
  interested in using R to analyze big bio-data, such as microarray and next-generation
  sequencing.
