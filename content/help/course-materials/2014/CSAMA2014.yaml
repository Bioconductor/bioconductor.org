title: Computational Statistics for Genome Biology (CSAMA)
description: This one-week intensive course teaches current approaches
  in the statistical and computational analysis of large-scale
  experiments in biology. The course focuses on the methods for
  downstream analyses of high-throughput sequencing experiments
  including RNA sequencing (differential expression), DNA sequencing
  (variant calling), ChIP-Seq. Lectures also cover essentials
  including statistical testing, linear models, machine learning,
  visualisation and bioinformatic annotation.  Emphasis is given to
  practical problem solving skills using open-source software from the
  Bioconductor, CRAN and other projects. The course is intended for
  researchers who have basic familiarity with the experimental
  technologies and the biology of the genome, and who are interested
  in developing their own, advanced data analyses using a scripting
  environment. The four practical sessions of the course will require
  simple script understanding in the computer language R. A tutorial
  on the required more advanced features of R will be provided,
  students are advised to familiarize themselves with the very basics
  of R beforehand. (Consider one of the many online resources or
  books, e.g. R-Intro from the R Project, Germán Rodríguez, R-Studio.
