description: DNA sequence analysis generates large volumes of data
  presenting challenging bioinformatic and statistical problems. This
  tutorial introduces Bioconductor packages and work flows for the
  analysis of sequence data. We learn about approaches for efficiently
  manipulating sequences and alignments, and introduce common work
  flows and the unique statistical challenges associated with
  'RNAseq', variant annotation, and other experiments. The emphasis is
  on exploratory analysis, and the analysis of designed
  experiments.The workshop emphasizes orientation within the
  Bioconductor milieu; we will touch on the Biostrings, ShortRead,
  GenomicRanges, GenomicAlignments, DESeq2, and VariantAnnotation, and
  other packages, with short exercises to illustrate the functionality
  of each package.
