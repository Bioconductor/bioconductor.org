description: 'This course is directed at beginning and intermediate users who would
  like an introduction to the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput sequence
  data using R and Bioconductor. Day 1 focuses on learning essential background: an
  introduction to the R programming language; central concepts for effective use of
  Bioconductor software; and an overview of high-throughput sequence analysis work
  flows. Day 2 emphasizes use of Bioconductor for specific tasks: an RNA-seq differential
  expression work flow; exploratory, machine learning, and other statistical tasks;
  gene set enrichment; and annotation. Day 3 transitions to understanding effective
  approaches for managing larger challenges: strategies for working with large data,
  writing re-usable functions, developing reproducible reports and work flows, and
  visualizing results. The course combines lectures with extensive hands-on practicals;
  students are required to bring a laptop with wireless internet access and a modern
  version of the Chrome or Safari web browser.'
