Thanks to its data handling and modeling capabilities and its
flexibility, R is becoming the most widely used software in
bioinformatics. _R Programming for Bioinformatics_ builds the
programming skills needed to use R for solving bioinformatics and
computational biology problems.

Drawing on the author's experiences as an R expert, the book begins
with coverage on the general properties of the R language, several
unique programming aspects of R, and object-oriented programming in
R. It presents methods for data input and output as well as database
interactions. The author also examines different facets of string
handling and manipulations, discusses the interfacing of R with other
languages, and describes how to write software packages. He concludes
with a discussion on the debugging and profiling of R code.
