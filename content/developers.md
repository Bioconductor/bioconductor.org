==========================================

Bioconductor is an open development project, meaning that all developers from
the scientific community are able to contribute software. In order to foster
coherence within the project, developers are encouraged to follow a common
set of [package guidelines](/developers/guidelines/) to make it easier for
other to use and extend the software. New software is added to the project
through a [package submission process](/developers/submission/).

Additionally, there is a
[Developer's Wiki](http://wiki.fhcrc.org/bioc/DeveloperPage/) that provides
information on the current direction of the core team and a
[developer mailing list](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/bioc-devel)
that facilitates communication amongst the Bioconductor developers.
