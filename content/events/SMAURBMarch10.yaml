title: Statistical Microarray Analysis Using R & Bioconductor 
location: London, UK
event_host: Imperial College
start: 2010-03-11
end:   2010-03-12
description:
  A two day course which will discuss microarray analysis, from the
  normalisation of the raw expression data, to the applying of valid
  statistical analyses, and the interpretation of results. This course is
  aimed at biologists and other researchers who want to learn how to analyse
  their microarray data using R and the Bioconductor project modules. 

  The course will consist of a series of formal lectures, practicals and
  exercises covering all aspects of statistical analysis of microarray data in
  R. The course discusses analysis of both Affymetrix arrays and two-channel
  cDNA arrays and covers a full range of topics, including the background to the
  technology, preprocessing and normalisation, methods for identifying
  differential expression and clustering and annotation.
