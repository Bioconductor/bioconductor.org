title: BioC 2010 European Developers' Meeting
location: Manchester, UK
event_host: University of Manchester
start: 2010-01-07
end:   2010-01-08
description:
  This year, the meeting will focus on the many challenges presented by
  Massively Parallel Nucleotide Sequencing, which include data management
  and storage through to statistics, visualisation and annotation. Many of
  these issues also affect the way we analyse data arising from other
  technologies, including microarrays and proteomics, so the meeting will
  therefore be of interest to many, even if they currently have no direct
  involvement with high throughput sequencing data. Sessions will include
  disccussions on data management, statistics, annotation and visualisation.
