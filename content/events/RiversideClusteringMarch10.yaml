description:
  R contains a comprehensive set of functions and libraries for clustering
  large multidimensional data sets. This course will provide an overview on
  the usage of the most common clustering techniques in R, such as
  hierarchical clustering with bootstrap, K-means, PAM, fuzzy clustering, QT,
  SOM, principal component analysis, multidimensional scaling, biclustering,
  etc. Knowledge of the R software, as introduced in the previous tutorial
  "Introduction into R", will be required for attending this workshop.
