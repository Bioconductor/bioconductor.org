description:
  This one week intensive course is intended to give insights into recent
  advances in statistical and computational aspects of the design and
  interpretation of microarray experiments. The topics will include all
  aspects of the data analysis of microarray experiments for transcript
  profiling and ChIP-chip. The course is intended mainly for researchers with
  a basic understanding of microarray technology and its statistical and
  computational challenges. The four practical sessions of the course will be
  most beneficial for participants that are able to converse in a programming
  language such as R.
