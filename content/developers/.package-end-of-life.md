#Software Package Retirement Policy

Creation Date: Antiquity.
Last Edit Date: 3 March 2015.

The Bioconductor project strives to provide a software repository that is stable
and relevant to users across the community. Each year 100-150 new software
packages are added to the repository; as of Spring 2015 over 900 packages are
hosted. The Bioconductor build system builds and checks each software package
every 24 hours. Regular execution of example, vignette and unit test code
ensures the package is operating as expected and all required dependencies are
available. The build system [link] provides a complete report for each package
across three platforms: Linux, Windows and Mac.

In an effort to maintain a high quality repository we have adopted a one-year 
retirement process for packages that fail to pass build or check and do not
have an active maintainer. Packages are assessed for retirement at the time
of each Bioconductor release.

** Required criteria **

- Error-free R CMD build and check on all platforms

The package must build and check error-free on all platforms at
the time of each Bioconductor release. All efforts will be made to keep a
package in the repository if the maintainer is actively attempting a fix.

- Active maintainer 

The maintainer listed in the DESCRIPTION file should be responsive to
questions on the mailing list, package-related emails and fix bugs.
If the package throws an error on build or check and there is no response
from the maintainer, the package will begin the retirement process.


** Retirement process **

Step I: warning (6 months)

Packages that fail build or check at release time are marked with
a package warning. The message is emitted when the package is loaded and
alerts users that it currently fails the minimal build/check criteria.

If at any time in this 6 month period the package is fixed and passes 
build/check, the warning is removed.


Step II: non-supported (6 months)

When a package has gone through one development cycle with a package warning it 
is then marked as 'non-supported'. The onload message indicates the package
fails to pass minimal build/check criteria, does not have an active 
maintainer and will be removed from the next Bioconductor release.

If at any time in this 6 month period the package is fixed and passes 
build/check, the warning is removed.


Step III: retired

A package that has (consecutively) completed Step I and Step II is 
removed from the next release. For one development cycle (6 months) the build 
report reports the package as 'retired'. 

Once a package has been retired it cannot be added back to the repository 
until it goes through a full package review.
