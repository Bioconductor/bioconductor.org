# ![](/images/icons/magnifier.gif)Developer Day 2013

Developer Day is part of the Bioconductor
[annual conference](/bioc2013); Developer Day is on July 17,
2013. This page is under active development, and will be until July
17!

## Tentative schedule

Morning

- Core team project highlights.

  Major developments this year: VariantAnnotation input and
  performance improvements; `filterVcf` [Valerie]. Managing seqlevels,
  AnnotationHub [Marc].
  
  New and emerging directions: Better paired end input [Valerie].
  Cloud-aided computation [e.g., ensemblVEP; AnnotationHub]).
  
  Favorite features: `showHeadLines`, `showTailLines`
  [Valerie]. BiocGenerics functionality.
  
  Google Summer of Code: displayR [Marc / Shawn]; BiocParallel.

- Group team-building activities. Possible ideas: _Quick Fix_ --
  implement, in small groups, a missing but generally useful feature
  to be shared by Bioconductor packages.

- Directions and Needs Discussion. Topics to be determined, including:
  approaches to variants (need for `tally` variants).

Afternoon

- Participant flashlight presentations (short talks). Title submission
  optional; spur-of-the-moment talks welcome. Current presentations:
  Paul Pyl, EMBL, rhdf5-supported variant calling; Tony Cox, Illumina,
  BaseSpaceR; Davide Rambaldi, flowFit for use in stem cell research.

- Developer workshops

- Developer Day address: JJ Alaire / RStudio
