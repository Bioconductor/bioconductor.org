# Add or Transfer Maintainership of a Package

__Goal:__ Perhaps there is a point in time where you can no longer maintain your
package in accordance with the Bioconductor package guidelines. It  may be
necessary to add or transfer maintainer-ship of a package in order to properly
maintain the package and avoid deprecation and removal.

1. Find a new maintainer

   You may have a collaborator or colleague volunteer to take over.  If not, ask
   on the [bioc-devel](/help/mailing-list/) mailing list.

2. Email <maintainer@bioconductor.org> or <bioc-devel@r-project.org>

   The original maintainer should email and request that the maintainer of the
   package be updated.  Include the package name and the contact information for
   the new maintainer.

3. Update Package DESCRIPTION file

   The DESCRIPTION file of the package should be updated to the new maintainer
   information and pushed to the Bioconductor git.bioconductor.org repository.
