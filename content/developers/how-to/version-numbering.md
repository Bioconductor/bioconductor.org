![](/images/icons/magnifier.gif)Version Numbering
=================

All _Bioconductor_ packages should have a version number like x.y.z.
Here are examples of good version numbers:

    1.2.3
    0.0.1
    0.99.5
    2.3.0
    3.12.44
    
First time developers (submitting a package to _Bioconductor_) should
set Version: 0.99.0 in the DESCRIPTION file; see additional details on
the [Package Submission](/developers/package-submission) page.

See also the instructions for [Using Bioc Devel][].

Even Odd Schedule
-----------------

_Bioconductor_ has a 'devel' branch where new features are introduced,
and release branches created twice per year.  Given a package with
version number x.y.z,

* y should be an odd number in devel.
* y should be an even number in release.

During regular development of new features

* Authors increment the z version of their package in the 'devel'
  branch by 1 for each svn commit, e.g., from 1.1.0 to 1.1.1, 1.1.2,
  ..., 1.1.10, 1.1.11
* Any bug fixes ported to the release branch are similarly
  incremented, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, ...
* Changes made to SVN without a corresponding version bump **do not
  propagate** to the repository visible to `biocLite()`.

At the time of a release, the _Bioconductor_ team arranges to:

* Create a release branch package with version x.y+1.0
* Increment the devel branch package version to x.y+2.0
* As a special case, any package with version x.99.z is bumped to
  x+1.0.0 in release, and x+1.1.0 in devel. Thus authors wishing to
  signify a major change to their package should set y to 99 in their
  devel package.

Example

1. Normal Case. Suppose a package in the devel branch has version
   number 1.1.25. The new release branch now contains a copy of the
   package with version "1.2.0".  The devel branch of _Bioconductor_
   contains the package whose version number has been bumped to
   "1.3.0"

2. Special Case.  The "0.99.2" version of our package is copied by the
   _Bioconductor_ team to the release branch with version number
   "1.0.0". The package version is bumped to "1.1.0" in the devel
   branch.

Here is a table showing examples of the version bumping scheme:
