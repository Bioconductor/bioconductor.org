<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

The Bioconductor project welcomes code developers who wish to apply, refine and extend their skills, working on
tasks and small projects we have identified as important, but which we have not had the time to tackle ourselves.   We will
offer technical support and advice to those working on any of these projects.   We predict that contributors, users, and established
Bioconductor developers will all benefit.


Below you will find a list of proposed projects.  We welcome other suggestions as well.

<h2 id="galaxy">Galaxy-ification of Useful Scripts</h2>
From the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_%28computational_biology%29">Wikipedia entry for Galaxy</a>:

<blockquote>
Galaxy is a scientific workflow, data integration, and data and
analysis persistence and publishing platform that aims to make
computational biology accessible to research scientists that do not
have computer programming experience. Although it was initially
developed for genomics research, it is largely domain agnostic and is
now used as a general bioinformatics workflow management system.
</blockquote>
The new Bioconductor <a href="packages/devel/bioc/html/RGalaxy.html">RGalaxy</a>
 simplifies the process of exposing an R function in Galaxy so that a user
can run the function using nothing more than a web browser.

This project would involve taking an existing workflow (or conceiving a new workflow)
and exposing it in Galaxy.

Project attributes and estimates:

* Difficulty: Medium
* Length: 1-2 weeks
* Skills needed: R programming
* Mentor: Dan Tenenbaum



<h2 id="vcf">New Variant Call Format (VCF) Class Methods</h2>

The VCF class is part of the <a href=http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.10/bioc/html/VariantAnnotation.html>Variant Annotation</a> package. 
These new capabilities are needed:

* Compute allele frequency (from the 'geno' slot

* Parse data in the 'alt' slot 

* Create (?) a SNP matrix for phased and unphased genotypes

Project attributes and estimates:

* Difficulty:
* Length
* Skills needed:  
* Mentor:

<h2 id='panther'> Create an AnnotationDbi Package for PANTHER</h2>

PANTHER is found <a href=http://www.pantherdb.org/>here</a>, and summarized:
<blockquote>

The PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships)
Classification System is a unique resource that classifies genes by
their functions, using published scientific experimental evidence and
evolutionary relationships to predict function even in the absence of
direct experimental evidence.  "classifies genes by their function"
</blockquote>

Project attributes and estimates:

* Difficulty:
* Length
* Skills needed:  
* Mentor:

We would like to see PANTHER annotation contained in a Bioconductor AnnotationDbi
package.

<h2 id="contact">Interested?</h2>

Please send mail to pshannon AT fhcrc DOT org if you would like to help out on any of these projects, or have an idea of your own which you
wish to propose.
