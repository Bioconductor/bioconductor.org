How-to guides are directed toward package developers and Bioconductor
contributors; topics are listed to the right. Contact us on the
[bioc-devel](/help/mailing-list/#bioc-devel)
mailing list if you have suggestions for improving current guides, if
you'd like to see additional topics, or if you have a guide (written
in markdown format) to contribute.
