New Software Packages
=====================

There are 95 new software packages in this release of Bioconductor.

- [abseqR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/abseqR) AbSeq is a
  comprehensive bioinformatic pipeline for the analysis of sequencing
  datasets generated from antibody libraries and abseqR is one of its
  packages. abseqR empowers the users of abseqPy
  (https://github.com/malhamdoosh/abseqPy) with plotting and
  reporting capabilities and allows them to generate interactive HTML
  reports for the convenience of viewing and sharing with other
  researchers. Additionally, abseqR extends abseqPy to compare
  multiple repertoire analyses and perform further downstream
  analysis on its output.

- [ACE](https://bioconductor.org/packages/ACE) Uses segmented copy
  number data to estimate tumor cell percentage and produce copy
  number plots displaying absolute copy numbers.

- [AffiXcan](https://bioconductor.org/packages/AffiXcan) Impute a
  GReX (Genetically Regulated Expression) for a set of genes in a
  sample of individuals, using a method based on the Total Binding
  Affinity (TBA). Statistical models to impute GReX can be trained
  with a training dataset where the real total expression values are
  known.

- [appreci8R](https://bioconductor.org/packages/appreci8R) The
  appreci8R is an R version of our appreci8-algorithm - A Pipeline
  for PREcise variant Calling Integrating 8 tools. Variant calling
  results of our standard appreci8-tools (GATK, Platypus, VarScan,
  FreeBayes, LoFreq, SNVer, samtools and VarDict), as well as up to 5
  additional tools is combined, evaluated and filtered.

- [artMS](https://bioconductor.org/packages/artMS) artMS provides a
  set of tools for the analysis of proteomics label-free datasets. It
  takes as input the MaxQuant search result output (evidence.txt
  file) and performs quality control, relative quantification using
  MSstats, downstream analysis and integration. artMS also provides a
  set of functions to re-format and make it compatible with other
  analytical tools, including, SAINTq, SAINTexpress, Phosfate, and
  PHOTON.

- [AssessORF](https://bioconductor.org/packages/AssessORF) In order
  to assess the quality of a set of predicted genes for a genome,
  evidence must first be mapped to that genome. Next, each gene must
  be categorized based on how strong the evidence is for or against
  that gene. The AssessORF package provides the functions and class
  structures necessary for accomplishing those tasks, using proteomic
  hits and evolutionarily conserved start codons as the forms of
  evidence.

- [bayNorm](https://bioconductor.org/packages/bayNorm) bayNorm is
  used for normalizing single-cell RNA-seq data.

- [BDMMAcorrect](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BDMMAcorrect)
  Metagenomic sequencing techniques enable quantitative analyses of
  the microbiome. However, combining the microbial data from these
  experiments is challenging due to the variations between
  experiments. The existing methods for correcting batch effects do
  not consider the interactions between variables—microbial taxa in
  microbial studies—and the overdispersion of the microbiome data.
  Therefore, they are not applicable to microbiome data. We develop a
  new method, Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial regression meta-analysis
  (BDMMA), to simultaneously model the batch effects and detect the
  microbial taxa associated with phenotypes. BDMMA automatically
  models the dependence among microbial taxa and is robust to the
  high dimensionality of the microbiome and their association
  sparsity.

- [BiocNeighbors](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BiocNeighbors)
  Implements exact and approximate methods for nearest neighbor
  detection, in a framework that allows them to be easily switched
  within Bioconductor packages or workflows. The exact algorithm is
  implemented using pre-clustering with the k-means algorithm, as
  described by Wang (2012). This is faster than conventional kd-trees
  for neighbor searching in higher (> 20) dimensional data. The
  approximate method uses the Annoy algorithm. Functions are also
  provided to search for all neighbors within a given distance.
  Parallelization is achieved for all methods using the BiocParallel
  framework.

- [BiocPkgTools](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BiocPkgTools)
  Bioconductor has a rich ecosystem of metadata around packages,
  usage, and build status. This package is a simple collection of
  functions to access that metadata from R. The goal is to expose
  metadata for data mining and value-added functionality such as
  package searching, text mining, and analytics on packages.

- [brainImageR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/brainImageR)
  BrainImageR is a package that provides the user with information of
  where in the human brain their gene set corresponds to. This is
  provided both as a continuous variable and as a
  easily-interpretable image. BrainImageR has additional
  functionality of identifying approximately when in developmental
  time that a gene expression dataset corresponds to. Both the
  spatial gene set enrichment and the developmental time point
  prediction are assessed in comparison to the Allen Brain Atlas
  reference data.

- [breakpointR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/breakpointR) This
  package implements functions for finding breakpoints, plotting and
  export of Strand-seq data.

- [BUScorrect](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BUScorrect)
  High-throughput experimental data are accumulating exponentially in
  public databases. However, mining valid scientific discoveries from
  these abundant resources is hampered by technical artifacts and
  inherent biological heterogeneity. The former are usually termed
  "batch effects," and the latter is often modelled by "subtypes."
  The R package BUScorrect fits a Bayesian hierarchical model, the
  Batch-effects-correction-with-Unknown-Subtypes model (BUS), to
  correct batch effects in the presence of unknown subtypes. BUS is
  capable of (a) correcting batch effects explicitly, (b) grouping
  samples that share similar characteristics into subtypes, (c)
  identifying features that distinguish subtypes, and (d) enjoying a
  linear-order computation complexity.

- [CAMTHC](https://bioconductor.org/packages/CAMTHC) An R package for
  tissue heterogeneity characterization by convex analysis of
  mixtures (CAM). It provides basic functions to perform unsupervised
  deconvolution on mixture expression profiles by CAM and some
  auxiliary functions to help understand the subpopulation-specific
  results. It also implements functions to perform supervised
  deconvolution based on prior knowledge of molecular markers, S
  matrix or A matrix. Combining molecular markers from CAM and from
  prior knowledge can achieve semi-supervised deconvolution of
  mixtures.

- [celaref](https://bioconductor.org/packages/celaref) After the
  clustering step of a single-cell RNAseq experiment, this package
  aims to suggest labels/cell types for the clusters, on the basis of
  similarity to a reference dataset. It requires a table of read
  counts per cell per gene, and a list of the cells belonging to each
  of the clusters, (for both test and reference data).

- [CellTrails](https://bioconductor.org/packages/CellTrails)
  CellTrails is an unsupervised algorithm for the de novo
  chronological ordering, visualization and analysis of single-cell
  expression data. CellTrails makes use of a geometrically motivated
  concept of lower-dimensional manifold learning, which exhibits a
  multitude of virtues that counteract intrinsic noise of single cell
  data caused by drop-outs, technical variance, and redundancy of
  predictive variables. CellTrails enables the reconstruction of
  branching trajectories and provides an intuitive graphical
  representation of expression patterns along all branches
  simultaneously. It allows the user to define and infer the
  expression dynamics of individual and multiple pathways towards
  distinct phenotypes.

- [cicero](https://bioconductor.org/packages/cicero) Cicero computes
  putative cis-regulatory maps from single-cell chromatin
  accessibility data. It also extends monocle 2 for use in chromatin
  accessibility data.

- [COCOA](https://bioconductor.org/packages/COCOA) COCOA is a method
  for understanding variation among samples and can be used with data
  that includes genomic coordinates such as DNA methylation. On a
  high level, COCOA uses a database of "region sets" and principal
  component analysis (PCA) of your data to identify sources of
  variation among samples. A region set is a set of genomic regions
  that share a biological annotation, for instance, transcription
  factor binding regions, histone modification regions, or open
  chromatin regions. COCOA works in both supervised (known groups of
  samples) and unsupervised (no groups) situations and can be used as
  a complement to "differential" methods that find discrete
  differences between groups. COCOA can identify biologically
  meaningful sources of variation between samples and increase
  understanding of variation in your data.

- [compartmap](https://bioconductor.org/packages/compartmap)
  Compartmap performs shrunken A/B compartment inference from
  ATAC-seq and methylation arrays.

- [condcomp](https://bioconductor.org/packages/condcomp) For a given
  clustered data, which can also be split into two conditions, this
  package provides a way to perform a condition comparison on said
  clustered data. The comparison is performed on each cluster.
  Several statistics are used and, when analysed in conjunction, they
  might give some insight regarding the heterogeneity of some of the
  clusters.

- [consensus](https://bioconductor.org/packages/consensus) An
  implementation of the American Society for Testing and Materials
  (ASTM) Standard E691 for interlaboratory testing procedures,
  designed for cross-platform genomic measurements. Given three (3)
  or more genomic platforms or laboratory protocols, this package
  provides interlaboratory testing procedures giving per-locus
  comparisons for sensitivity and precision between platforms.

- [consensusDE](https://bioconductor.org/packages/consensusDE) This
  package allows users to perform DE analysis using multiple
  algorithms. It seeks consensus from multiple methods. Currently it
  supports "Voom", "EdgeR" and "DESeq", but can be easily extended.
  It uses RUV-seq (optional) to remove batch effects.

- [coRdon](https://bioconductor.org/packages/coRdon) Tool for
  analysis of codon usage in various unannotated or KEGG/COG
  annotated DNA sequences. Calculates different measures of CU bias
  and CU-based predictors of gene expressivity, and performs gene set
  enrichment analysis for annotated sequences. Implements several
  methods for visualization of CU and enrichment analysis results.

- [countsimQC](https://bioconductor.org/packages/countsimQC)
  countsimQC provides functionality to create a comprehensive report
  comparing a broad range of characteristics across a collection of
  count matrices. One important use case is the comparison of one or
  more synthetic count matrices to a real count matrix, possibly the
  one underlying the simulations. However, any collection of count
  matrices can be compared.

- [cTRAP](https://bioconductor.org/packages/cTRAP) Compare
  differential gene expression results with those from known cellular
  perturbations (such as gene knock-down, overexpression or small
  molecules) derived from the Connectivity Map. Such analyses allow
  not only to infer the molecular causes of the observed difference
  in gene expression but also to identify small molecules that could
  drive or revert specific transcriptomic alterations.

- [DEqMS](https://bioconductor.org/packages/DEqMS) DEqMS is
  developped on top of Limma. However, Limma assumes same prior
  variance for all genes. In proteomics, the accuracy of protein
  abundance estimates varies by the number of peptides/PSMs
  quantified in both label-free and labelled data. Proteins
  quantification by multiple peptides or PSMs are more accurate.
  DEqMS package is able to estimate different prior variances for
  proteins quantified by different number of PSMs/peptides, therefore
  acchieving better accuracy. The package can be applied to analyze
  both label-free and labelled proteomics data.

- [EnhancedVolcano](https://bioconductor.org/packages/EnhancedVolcano)
  Volcano plots represent a useful way to visualise the results of
  differential expression analyses. Here, we present a
  highly-configurable function that produces publication-ready
  volcano plots. EnhancedVolcano will attempt to fit as many
  transcript names in the plot window as possible, thus avoiding
  'clogging' up the plot with labels that could not otherwise have
  been read.

- [ERSSA](https://bioconductor.org/packages/ERSSA) The ERSSA package
  takes user supplied RNA-seq differential expression dataset and
  calculates the number of differentially expressed genes at varying
  biological replicate levels. This allows the user to determine,
  without relying on any a priori assumptions, whether sufficient
  differential detection has been acheived with their RNA-seq
  dataset.

- [ExCluster](https://bioconductor.org/packages/ExCluster) ExCluster
  flattens Ensembl and GENCODE GTF files into GFF files, which are
  used to count reads per non-overlapping exon bin from BAM files.
  This read counting is done using the function featureCounts from
  the package Rsubread. Library sizes are normalized across all
  biological replicates, and ExCluster then compares two different
  conditions to detect signifcantly differentially spliced genes.
  This process requires at least two independent biological repliates
  per condition, and ExCluster accepts only exactly two conditions at
  a time. ExCluster ultimately produces false discovery rates (FDRs)
  per gene, which are used to detect significance. Exon log2 fold
  change (log2FC) means and variances may be plotted for each
  significantly differentially spliced gene, which helps scientists
  develop hypothesis and target differential splicing events for
  RT-qPCR validation in the wet lab.

- [FastqCleaner](https://bioconductor.org/packages/FastqCleaner) An
  interactive web application for quality control, filtering and
  trimming of FASTQ files. This user-friendly tool combines a
  pipeline for data processing based on Biostrings and ShortRead
  infrastructure, with a cutting-edge visual environment. Single-Read
  and Paired-End files can be locally processed. Diagnostic
  interactive plots (CG content, per-base sequence quality, etc.) are
  provided for both the input and output files.

- [FCBF](https://bioconductor.org/packages/FCBF) This package
  provides a simple R implementation for the Fast Correlation Based
  Filter described in Yu, L. and Liu, H.; Feature Selection for
  High-Dimensional Data: A Fast Correlation Based Filter
  Solution,Proc. 20th Intl. Conf. Mach. Learn. (ICML-2003),
  Washington DC, 2003 The current package is an intent to make easier
  for bioinformaticians to use FCBF for feature selection, especially
  regarding transcriptomic data.This implies discretizing expression
  (function discretize_exprs) before calculating the features that
  explain the class, but are not predictable by other features. The
  functions are implemented based on the algorithm of Yu and Liu,
  2003 and Rajarshi Guha's implementation from 13/05/2005 available
  (as of 26/08/2018) at http://www.rguha.net/code/R/fcbf.R .

- [FoldGO](https://bioconductor.org/packages/FoldGO) FoldGO is a
  package designed to annotate gene sets derived from expression
  experiments and identify fold-change-specific GO terms.

- [GeneAccord](https://bioconductor.org/packages/GeneAccord) A
  statistical framework to examine the combinations of clones that
  co-exist in tumors. More precisely, the algorithm finds pairs of
  genes that are mutated in the same tumor but in different clones,
  i.e. their subclonal mutation profiles are mutually exclusive. We
  refer to this as clonally exclusive. It means that the mutations
  occurred in different branches of the tumor phylogeny, indicating
  parallel evolution of the clones. Our statistical framework
  assesses whether a pattern of clonal exclusivity occurs more often
  than expected by chance alone across a cohort of patients. The
  required input data are the mutated gene-to-clone assignments from
  a cohort of cancer patients, which were obtained by running
  phylogenetic tree inference methods. Reconstructing the
  evolutionary history of a tumor and detecting the clones is
  challenging. For nondeterministic algorithms, repeated tree
  inference runs may lead to slightly different mutation-to-clone
  assignments. Therefore, our algorithm was designed to allow the
  input of multiple gene-to-clone assignments per patient. They may
  have been generated by repeatedly performing the tree inference, or
  by sampling from the posterior distribution of trees. The tree
  inference methods designate the mutations to individual clones. The
  mutations can then be mapped to genes or pathways. Hence our
  statistical framework can be applied on the gene level, or on the
  pathway level to detect clonally exclusive pairs of pathways. If a
  pair is significantly clonally exclusive, it points towards the
  fact that this specific clone configuration confers a selective
  advantage, possibly through synergies between the clones with these
  mutations.

- [GIGSEA](https://bioconductor.org/packages/GIGSEA) We presented the
  Genotype-imputed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GIGSEA), a novel
  method that uses GWAS-and-eQTL-imputed trait-associated
  differential gene expression to interrogate gene set enrichment for
  the trait-associated SNPs. By incorporating eQTL from large gene
  expression studies, e.g. GTEx, GIGSEA appropriately addresses such
  challenges for SNP enrichment as gene size, gene boundary, SNP
  distal regulation, and multiple-marker regulation. The weighted
  linear regression model, taking as weights both imputation accuracy
  and model completeness, was used to perform the enrichment test,
  properly adjusting the bias due to redundancy in different gene
  sets. The permutation test, furthermore, is used to evaluate the
  significance of enrichment, whose efficiency can be largely
  elevated by expressing the computational intensive part in terms of
  large matrix operation. We have shown the appropriate type I error
  rates for GIGSEA (<5%), and the preliminary results also
  demonstrate its good performance to uncover the real signal.

- [glmSparseNet](https://bioconductor.org/packages/glmSparseNet)
  glmSparseNet is an R-package that generalizes sparse regression
  models when the features (e.g. genes) have a graph structure (e.g.
  protein-protein interactions), by including network-based
  regularizers. glmSparseNet uses the glmnet R-package, by including
  centrality measures of the network as penalty weights in the
  regularization. The current version implements regularization based
  on node degree, i.e. the strength and/or number of its associated
  edges, either by promoting hubs in the solution or orphan genes in
  the solution. All the glmnet distribution families are supported,
  namely "gaussian", "poisson", "binomial", "multinomial", "cox", and
  "mgaussian".

- [gpart](https://bioconductor.org/packages/gpart) we provide a new
  SNP sequence partitioning method which partitions the whole SNP
  sequence based on not only LD block structures but also gene
  location information. The LD block construction for GPART is
  performed using Big-LD algorithm, with additional improvement from
  previous version reported in Kim et al.(2017). We also add a
  visualization tool to show the LD heatmap with the information of
  LD block boundaries and gene locations in the package.

- [gwasurvivr](https://bioconductor.org/packages/gwasurvivr)
  gwasurvivr is a package to perform survival analysis using Cox
  proportional hazard models on imputed genetic data.

- [HiCBricks](https://bioconductor.org/packages/HiCBricks) A flexible
  framework for storing and accessing high-resolution Hi-C data
  through HDF files. HiCBricks allows import of Hi-C data through
  various formats such as the 2D matrix format or a generalized
  n-column table formats. In terms of access, HiCBricks offers
  functions to retrieve values from genomic loci separated by a
  certain distance, or the ability to fetch matrix subsets using word
  alike terms. HiCBricks will at a later point offer the ability to
  fetch multiple matrix subsets using fewer calls. It offers the
  capacity to store GenomicRanges that may be associated to a
  particular Hi-C experiment, to do basic ranges overlap (any,
  within) with the Hi-C experiment associated Ranges object and also
  to store any metadata that users may think to be relevant for their
  Hi-C experiment. Finally, you can do TAD calls with LSD and create
  pretty heatmaps.

- [hierinf](https://bioconductor.org/packages/hierinf) Tools to
  perform hierarchical inference for one or multiple studies / data
  sets based on high-dimensional multivariate (generalised) linear
  models. A possible application is to perform hierarchical inference
  for GWA studies to find significant groups or single SNPs (if the
  signal is strong) in a data-driven and automated procedure. The
  method is based on an efficient hierarchical multiple testing
  correction and controls the FWER. The functions can easily be run
  in parallel.

- [HIREewas](https://bioconductor.org/packages/HIREewas) In
  epigenome-wide association studies, the measured signals for each
  sample are a mixture of methylation profiles from different cell
  types. The current approaches to the association detection only
  claim whether a cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) site is associated
  with the phenotype or not, but they cannot determine the cell type
  in which the risk-CpG site is affected by the phenotype. We propose
  a solid statistical method, HIgh REsolution (HIRE), which not only
  substantially improves the power of association detection at the
  aggregated level as compared to the existing methods but also
  enables the detection of risk-CpG sites for individual cell types.
  The "HIREewas" R package is to implement HIRE model in R.

- [HPAanalyze](https://bioconductor.org/packages/HPAanalyze) Provide
  functions for retrieving, exploratory analyzing and visualizing the
  Human Protein Atlas data.

- [iasva](https://bioconductor.org/packages/iasva) Iteratively
  Adjusted Surrogate Variable Analysis (IA-SVA) is a statistical
  framework to uncover hidden sources of variation even when these
  sources are correlated. IA-SVA provides a flexible methodology to
  i) identify a hidden factor for unwanted heterogeneity while
  adjusting for all known factors; ii) test the significance of the
  putative hidden factor for explaining the unmodeled variation in
  the data; and iii), if significant, use the estimated factor as an
  additional known factor in the next iteration to uncover further
  hidden factors.

- [icetea](https://bioconductor.org/packages/icetea) icetea
  (Integrating Cap Enrichment with Transcript Expression Analysis)
  provides functions for end-to-end analysis of multiple 5'-profiling
  methods such as CAGE, RAMPAGE and MAPCap, beginning from raw reads
  to detection of transcription start sites using replicates. It also
  allows performing differential TSS detection between group of
  samples, therefore, integrating the mRNA cap enrichment information
  with transcript expression analysis.

- [INDEED](https://bioconductor.org/packages/INDEED) An
  Implementation of Integrated Differential Expression and
  Differential Network Analysis of Omic Data. The differential
  network is obtained based on partial correlation or correlation.

  to construct LRBase package (LRBase.XXX.eg.db).

- [maser](https://bioconductor.org/packages/maser) This package
  provides functionalities for analysis, annotation and visualizaton
  of alternative splicing events.

- [methylGSA](https://bioconductor.org/packages/methylGSA) The main
  functions for methylGSA are methylglm and methylRRA. methylGSA
  implements logistic regression adjusting number of probes as a
  covariate. methylRRA adjusts multiple p-values of each gene by
  Robust Rank Aggregation. For more detailed help information, please
  see the vignette.

- [MetID](https://bioconductor.org/packages/MetID) This package uses
  an innovative network-based approach that will enhance our ability
  to determine the identities of significant ions detected by LC-MS.

- [MetNet](https://bioconductor.org/packages/MetNet) MetNet contains
  functionality to infer metabolic network topologies from
  quantitative data and high-resolution mass/charge information.
  Using statistical models (including correlation, mutual
  information, regression and Bayes statistics) and quantitative data
  (intensity values of features) adjacency matrices are inferred that
  can be combined to a consensus matrix. Mass differences calculated
  between mass/charge values of features will be matched against a
  data frame of supplied mass/charge differences referring to
  transformations of enzymatic activities. In a third step, the two
  matrices are combined to form a adjacency matrix inferred from both
  quantitative and structure information.

- [miRSM](https://bioconductor.org/packages/miRSM) The package aims
  to identify miRNA sponge modules by integrating expression data and
  miRNA-target binding information. It provides several functions to
  study miRNA sponge modules, including popular methods for inferring
  gene modules (candidate miRNA sponge modules), and a function to
  identify miRNA sponge modules, as well as a function to conduct
  functional analysis of miRNA sponge modules.

- [mixOmics](https://bioconductor.org/packages/mixOmics) Multivariate
  methods are well suited to large omics data sets where the number
  of variables (e.g. genes, proteins, metabolites) is much larger
  than the number of samples (patients, cells, mice). They have the
  appealing properties of reducing the dimension of the data by using
  instrumental variables (components), which are defined as
  combinations of all variables. Those components are then used to
  produce useful graphical outputs that enable better understanding
  of the relationships and correlation structures between the
  different data sets that are integrated. mixOmics offers a wide
  range of multivariate methods for the exploration and integration
  of biological datasets with a particular focus on variable
  selection. The package proposes several sparse multivariate models
  we have developed to identify the key variables that are highly
  correlated, and/or explain the biological outcome of interest. The
  data that can be analysed with mixOmics may come from high
  throughput sequencing technologies, such as omics data
  (transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, metagenomics etc) but
  also beyond the realm of omics (e.g. spectral imaging). The methods
  implemented in mixOmics can also handle missing values without
  having to delete entire rows with missing data. A non exhaustive
  list of methods include variants of generalised Canonical
  Correlation Analysis, sparse Partial Least Squares and sparse
  Discriminant Analysis. Recently we implemented integrative methods
  to combine multiple data sets: N-integration with variants of
  Generalised Canonical Correlation Analysis and P-integration with
  variants of multi-group Partial Least Squares.

- [mlm4omics](https://bioconductor.org/packages/mlm4omics) To conduct
  Bayesian inference regression for responses with multilevel
  explanatory variables and missing values; It uses function from
  'Stan', a software to implement posterior sampling using
  Hamiltonian MC and its variation Non-U-Turn algorithms. It
  implements the posterior sampling of regression coefficients from
  the multilevel regression models. The package has two main
  functions to handle not-missing-at-random missing responses and
  left-censored with not-missing-at random responses. The purpose is
  to provide a similar format as the other R regression functions but
  using 'Stan' models.

- [MPRAnalyze](https://bioconductor.org/packages/MPRAnalyze)
  MPRAnalyze provides statistical framework for the analysis of data
  generated by Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs), used to
  directly measure enhancer activity. MPRAnalyze can be used for
  quantification of enhancer activity, classification of active
  enhancers and comparative analyses of enhancer activity between
  conditions. MPRAnalyze construct a nested pair of generalized
  linear models (GLMs) to relate the DNA and RNA observations, easily
  adjustable to various experimental designs and conditions, and
  provides a set of rigorous statistical testig schemes.

- [MSstatsTMT](https://bioconductor.org/packages/MSstatsTMT) Tools
  for protein significance analysis in shotgun mass
  spectrometry-based proteomic experiments with tandem mass tag (TMT)
  labeling.

  analysis tools for mitochondrial genetics.

- [multiHiCcompare](https://bioconductor.org/packages/multiHiCcompare)
  multiHiCcompare provides functions for joint normalization and
  difference detection in multiple Hi-C datasets. This extension of
  the original HiCcompare package now allows for Hi-C experiments
  with more than 2 groups and multiple samples per group.
  multiHiCcompare operates on processed Hi-C data in the form of
  sparse upper triangular matrices. It accepts four column
  (chromosome, region1, region2, IF) tab-separated text files storing

  platforms. The data analyzed here is a typical clinical microarray
  data set that compares inflamed and non-inflamed colon tissue in
  two disease subtypes. For each disease, the differential gene
  expression between inflamed- and non-inflamed colon tissue was

  line BiocCheckGitClone which is only run on a source directory not a
  tarball. This will check for bad system files

- (1.17.17) BiocCheck addition: Checks vignette directory for
  intermediate and end files that should not be included.

- (1.17.16) Checks for Bioconductor package size requirement if
  checking tarball

BUG FIXES

- (1.17.19) Updated internal functions to use BiocManger instead of
  BiocInstaller

-------------

Changes in version 1.5:

NEW FEATURES

- (v. 1.5.1) Add 'exact = ' for exact matching in bfcquery(),
  bfcrpath(). (v. 1.5.2) defaults to TRUE for bfcrpath()

BUG FIX

  rnames.

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- (v. 1.5.4) bfcpath() implementation change. Only displays rpath and
  can work with multiple rids. bfcpath only for rpath access while
  bfcrpath is the option to get or add.

[BiocInstaller](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BiocInstaller)
-------------

Changes in version 1.31.2:

NEW FEATURES

- 'BiocInstaller' is currently deprecated. All installation of
  Bioconductor packages will be done via `BiocManager` a CRAN package.

BUG FIXES

- The documentation incorrectly refered to `remotes::install` which is
  not an exported function of the package. This link was fixed.

[BiocNeighbors](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BiocNeighbors)
-------------

Changes in version 1.0.0:

- New package kmknn, for k-means-based k-nearest neighbor detection.

- Improve efficiency of code in vignettes.

- Change the news section

- Adding a section about GeneOverlap package.

- Changed the License

[BiocParallel](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BiocParallel)
------------

Changes in version 1.16:

NEW FEATURES

- (v 1.15.9) BatchtoolsParam() gains resources=list() for template file
  substitution.

- (v 1.15.12) bpexportglobals() for all BPPARAM exports global options
  (i.e., base::options()) to workers. Default TRUE.

BUG FIXES

- (v 1.15.6) bpiterate,serial-method does not return a list() when
  REDUCE present
  (https://github.com/Bioconductor/BiocParallel/issues/77)

- (v 1.15.7) bpaggregate,formula-method failed to find BPREDO
  (https://support.bioconductor.org/p/110784)

- (v 1.15.13) bplappy,BatchtoolsParam() coerces List to list
  (https://github.com/Bioconductor/BiocParallel/issues/82)

- (v 1.15.14) implicit loading of BiocParallel when loading a third-
  party package failed because reference class `initialize()` methods
  are not installed correctly. This bug fix results in signficant
  revision in the implementation, so that valid objects must be
  constructed through the public constructors, e.g.,
  `BatchtoolsParam()`

[breakpointR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/breakpointR)
-----------

Changes in version 0.99.0:

- This package implements various functions to find template strand
  changepoints in Strand-seq data.

[bsseq](https://bioconductor.org/packages/bsseq)
-----

Changes in version 1.17:

- BSseq() will no longer reorder inputs. Previously, the returned
  _BSseq_ object was ordered by ordering the loci, although this
  behaviour was not documented. BSseq() may still filter out loci if
  rmZeroCov = FALSE or collapse loci if strandCollapse = FALSE or
  duplicate loci are detected, but the relative order of loci in the
  output will match that of the input.

- Fix bug with maxGap argument of BSmooth(). The bug meant that the
  'maximum gap between two methylation loci' was incorrectly set to 2 *
  maxGap + 1 instead of maxGap. This likely did not affect results for
  users who left the default value of maxGap = 10^8 but may have
  affected results for small values of maxGap.

[BUScorrect](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BUScorrect)
----------

Changes in version 0.99.13 (2018-10-09):

- Improved the ``postprob\_DE\_thr\_fun'' function.

Changes in version 0.99.6 (2018-07-27):

- Created a NEWS.Rd file parsable by utils::news within the inst folder

[CAGEfightR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/CAGEfightR)
----------

Changes in version 1.5:

- Added new functions for spatial analysis of clusters: findLinks finds
  nearby pairs of clusters (for example TSSs and enhancers) and
  calculates the correlation of expression between them. findStretches
  find stretches along the genome where clusters are within a certain
  distance of eachother (for example groups of enhancer forming a super
  enhancer) and calculates the average pairwise correlation between
  members.

- Changed the way clustering works: CAGEfightR uses coverage() to
  calculate genome-wide signals and now rounds the resulting signal to
  a certain number of digits (this can be modified via the
  CAGEfightR.round option), to prevent small positive or negative
  values due to floating point errors. This makes clustering more
  stable meaning the tuneTagClustering function is now deprecated. This
  should also increase the speed of most functions.

- CAGEfightR now uses GPos instead of GRanges for storing CTSSs, this
  should result in improved memory performance.

- Several changes to clusterBidirectionality: Balance is now calculated
  using the midpoint as well (preventing some rare cases where the
  midpoint could mask a single highly expressed CTSS), the pooled CTSS
  signal is now prefiltered for bidirectionality to increase speed and
  custom balance function can be provided (Bhattacharyya coefficient
  and Andersson's D are included).

- Added new check-functions to make it easier to check if objects are
  formatted correctly

[CAGEr](https://bioconductor.org/packages/CAGEr)
-----

Changes in version 1.24.0:

NEW FEATURES

- plotAnnot(): the "group" argument now accepts formulas such as "~ a +
  b" to indicate names of metadata column that will be pasted together
  to form a new group factor.

BUG FIXES

- Prevent mergeSamples() from producing colData that cause other
  functions to crash later when coercing to data.frame.

- Repaired paraclu support for CAGEset objects.

- normalizeTagCount() works again on CAGEset objects.

- consensusClustersGR() reports expression score of the selected sample
  (instead of silently ignoring the "sample" argument and reporting
  expression sum on all the samples).

- Reformatted NEWS file.

Changes in version 1.9.1:

- Reconfigured KEGG pathway downloading via KEGG API.

[ClassifyR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/ClassifyR)
---------

Changes in version 2.2.0:

- getClasses is no longer a slot of PredictParams. Every predictor
  function needs to return either a factor vector of classes, a numeric
  vector of class scores for the second class, or a data frame with a
  column for the predicted classes and another for the second-class
  scores.

- Cross-validations which use folds ensure that samples belonging to
  each class are in approximately the same proportions as they are for
  the entire data set.

- Classification can reuse fitted model from previous classification by
  using previousTrained function.

- Feature selection using gene sets and networks. Classification can
  use meta-features derived from the individual features used for
  feature selection.

- tTestSelection function for feature selection based on ordinary
  t-test statistic ranking. Now the default feature selection function,
  if none is specified.

- Tuning parameter optimisation metric is specified by providing a
  tuneOptimise parameter to TrainParams rather than depending on
  ResubstituteParams being used during feature selection.

[clusterExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/clusterExperiment)
-----------------

Changes in version 2.1.5 (2018-06-28):

Changes

- Add functionality to `getBestFeatures` to allow `edgeR` for DE, as
  well as weights used with `edgeR` for `zinbwave` compatability. As
  part of this change: - Removed `isCount` argument and replaced with
  more fine-grained `DEMethod` argument in `getBestFeatures`,
  `mergeClusters`; or `mergeDEMethod` in `RSEC`. - *Change to class
  definition*: added slot `merge_demethod` to keep track of the DE
  method used in merging

- Change function names (old function name is now depricated): -
  `combineMany` -> `makeConsensus` - `removeUnclustered` ->
  `removeUnassigned`

- Arguments to functions changed: - `combineProportion` ->
  `consensusProportion` in `RSEC` - `combineMinSize` ->
  `consensusMinSize` in `RSEC` - `sampleData` -> `colData` to match
  `SummarizedExperiment` syntax (in many plotting functions).  -
  `alignSampleData` -> `alignColData` in `plotHeatmap` -
  `ignoreUnassignedVar` -> `filterIgnoresUnassigned` in `mergeClusters`
  (and other functions) for clarity. - `removeNegative` ->
  `removeUnassigned` in `getBestFeatures` for uniformity - Removed
  `largeDataset` option to `subsampleClustering` because no longer
  provides advantage. - `nBlank` -> `nBlankFeatures` in `makeBlankData`
  to allow for samples

- Created functions: - `primaryClusterLabel` and `primaryClusterType` -
  `getReducedData` - `assignUnassigned`: assigns unassigned samples to
  nearest cluster - `renameClusters` and `recolorClusters`: assign new
  names/colors to clusters within a particular clustering -
  `clusterMatrixColors`: wrapper to `convertClusterLegend` to return
  matrix like `clusterMatrix` only with colors in place of the internal
  cluster ids (like existing `clusterMatrixNamed`) -
  `plotClustersTable` for plotting a heatmap showing the results of
  `tableClusters` - `subsetByCluster` for subsetting CE object to only
  those samples in a particular cluster(s) of a clustering. -
  `plotFeatureScatter` for a scatter plot of 2+ features (genes)
  colored by cluster - `addToColData` and `colDataClusters` adding
  clustering information to colData of object. `addToColData` returns
  object with `colData` augmented, while `colDataClusters` just returns
  the `DataFrame` with clusterings added. - `updateObject` to update
  historical object created from previous versions to the current class
  definitions.

- Added arguments: - `whichAssay` to all functions to allow the user to
  select the assay on which the operations will be performed. -
  `stopOnErrors` to `RSEC` - `nColLegend` to `plotReducedDims` -
  `subsample` and `sequential` to `RSEC` to allow for opting out of
  those options (but default is `TRUE` unlike `clusterMany`) -
  `nBlankSamples` and `groupsOfSamples` to `makeBlankData` to allow for
  separating samples (columns) - `add` and `location` to
  `plotClusterLegend`

- `makeBlankData` will now allow for making blank columns to separate
  groups of samples.

- `plotDendrogram` now allows for plotting of `colData` (previously
  `sampleData`) like `plotHeatmap` or `plotClusters`

- `clusterMany` now allows user-defined `ClusterFunction` objects to
  argument `clusterFunction`.

- Removed restriction in `plotClustersWorkflow` that only
  `clusterType="clusterMany"` allowed.

- Allow `getClusterManyParams` to search old `clusterMany` runs as
  well.

- Added `table` method to `plotHeatmap` (for plotting heatmap of
  results of `table` function)

- Added error catch if try to give argument `whichCluster` to
  `mergeCluster`.

- Added error catch if give param `whichClusters` to functions that
  only take `whichCluster` (singular) as an argument

- `plotFeatureBoxplot` now returns (invisibly) the colors and
  clusterIds along with the boxplot information.

Bugs

- Add check for merge_nodeMerge table that `mergeClusterId` column
  can't be NA for entries where `isMerged=TRUE`

- Fix internal .makeIntegerClusters so that if given values `1:K` for
  input clustering will retain these same values (Issue #227)

- `mergeClusters` now returned object saves the merge information (and
  deletes old info and updates clusterType/clusterLabel of existing
  merge clusters), even if `mergeMethod="none"`.

- Fix `removeClusterings` so doesn't loose merge info unless deleting
  relevant clusterings.

Changes in version 2.1.4 (2018-06-27):

Bugs

- Fix tests that fail in devel version of Bioconductor (due to changes
  in other packages)

Changes in version 2.1.3 (2018-05-24):

  choices in `reduceMethod`.

- Fixed bug in how `clusterMany` assigned label names

- Fixed bug so that `clusterMany` labels are increased (iteration
  version added) if `clusterMany` is rerun. Also, user-defined labels
  for functions like `mergeClusters` are now updated with iteration
  value if they are duplicated.

Changes in version 2.1.2 (2018-05-17):

Bugs

- Fix so that estimates of the proportion non-null in `mergeClusters`
  are always positive.

- Fix so that calculation of filter with `ignoreUnassignedVar` doesn't
  delete existing base filter of same type.

- Fix `plotClustersWorkflow` where wrong cluster was grabbed to plot.

- Fix bug in `plotDendrogram` where colors of clusters plotted with
  could be subsumbed by color of previous clustering. (git Issue
  `#220`)

Changes in version 2.1.1 (2018-05-15):

Bugs: 

- Fixed error introduced in 2.0.0 where arguments to `mergeCutoff` and
  `mergeLogFCcutoff` were passed instead to `dendroNDims`.

  updated removing a useless call to hclust, thus reducing by half the
  time required for clustering.  + topGOres.R: the function was sligtly
  modified to be more efficient in case of GO enrichment analysis of
  multiple gene sets. The indexing of the ontology is now performed
  only once, greatly improving the speed of the function.

[dada2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/dada2)
-----

Changes in version 1.9.2:

NEW FEATURES

- PacBio CCS reads up to 3 kilobases are now supported. See also
  PacBioErrfun, the new and recommended error-estimation function for
  PacBio CCS data.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- primer.fwd has been replaced by orient.fwd in the filterAndTrim
  function. This option consistently orients mixed-orientation
  single-end or paired-end reads based on matching the provided
  sequence fragment to the start or end of each read (or paired read).
  Intended for use with mixed-orientation reads that included sequenced
  primers. If primers aren't included in the amplicons, an external
  re-orientation solution remains preferable.

- trimRight has been added to the filterAndTrim function. This removes
  the specified number of bases from the end ("right" side) of each
  read.

BUG FIXES

- collapseNoMismatch now collapses identical sequences as well
  (previous behavior is togglable).

Changes in version 1.9.1:

BUG FIXES

- mergePairs now gracefully handles cases when zero reads succesfully
  merge.

- plotQualityProfile now works correclty when given a directory
  containing fastq files.

[DaMiRseq](https://bioconductor.org/packages/DaMiRseq)
--------

Changes in version 1.5.2:

- The DaMiR.normalization function embeds also the 'logcpm'
  normalization.

- Now, DaMiR.EnsembleLearning calculates also the Positive Predicted
  Values (PPV) and the Negative Predicted Values (NPV).

- Three new functions have been implemented for the binary
  classification task: DaMiR.EnsembleLearning2cl_Training,
  DaMiR.EnsembleLearning2cl_Test and DaMiR.EnsembleLearning2cl_Predict.
  The first one allows the user to implement the training task and to
  select the model with the highest accuracy or the average accuracy;
  the second function allows the user to test the selected
  classification model on a test set defined by the user; the last
  function allows the user to predict the class of new samples.

- Removed black dots in the violin plots.

Changes in version 1.4.1:

- Adjusted Sensitivity and Specificity calculations.

[derfinder](https://bioconductor.org/packages/derfinder)
---------

Changes in version 1.15.4:

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- Switched from 'outfile' to 'log' when invoking
  BiocParalle::SnowParam(). Thus define_cluster() now has a mc.log
  argument instead of mc.outfile.

Changes in version 1.15.1:

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- Use BiocManager

[DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/DESeq2)
------

Changes in version 1.22.0:

- No replicate designs no longer supported (previous version began
  deprecation with a warning).

- unmix() now optionally will return the correlation (in the variance
  stabilized space) of the fitted data to the original data, and the
  matrix of fitted data (format="list"). Argument 'loss' was changed to
  'power'. Will give warning if the columns of 'pure' have high
  correlation (in the variance stabilized space).

Changes in version 1.21.21:

- Improved code for 'linearModelMu' (an internal fitting function used
  in dispersion estimation for some models) contributed by Wolfgang
  Huber speeds up an internal step by 2 orders of magnitude.

Changes in version 1.21.15:

- Rows of the weights matrix which would produce a degenerate design
  matrix, instead of giving an error, will produce a warning, and these
  rows will be treated as if they contained all zeros
  (mcols(dds)$allZero and mcols(dds)$weightsFail will be set to TRUE).

Changes in version 1.21.14:

- The nbinom{WaldTest,LRT} functions will not stop if the design
  produces a model matrix that is not full rank and betaPrior=FALSE
  (default). This was assumed by the DESeq2 code, because errors are
  produced at object construction and at dispersion estimation, but it
  was possible to call nbinomLRT() from DEXSeq after dispersion
  estimation and end up with a full model matrix that was not full
  rank. Instead testForDEU() should be called from DEXSeq.

Changes in version 1.21.13:

- Adding back a feature from version 1.15, where contrasts of two
  groups where both had all zero counts would have the LFC zero-ed out,
  rather than output a small but non-zero value. It's preferable for
  the Wald test that the LFC be set to zero for such contrasts.

Changes in version 1.21.9:

- DESeq() now only says one time 'using supplied model matrix',
  previously this was repeated three times from sub-functions.
  Sub-functions therefore no longer print this message.

- Fixed bug when lfcShrink run directly after LRT with supplied model
  matrices.

- Added heuristic to prevent Cook's outlier based filtering when the
  max Cook's sample has lower counts than 3 other samples. Restricted
  to two group comparison datasets.

- Helper functions in helpers.R (to plot diffusion scores, to check if
  a kernel matrix is actually a kernel, to extract largest CC from a
  graph)

---------------------

Changes in version 1.3.10:

  cause continuous co-variables to interpreted as discrete
  co-variables.

- importRdata() was updated to be a bit more versetile with regards to
  accepting isoform_ids as row.names.

- Both isoformSwitchTestDRIMSeq() and isoformSwitchTestDRIMSeq() was
  updated so the the resulting "isoformSwitchAnalysis" entry in the
  switchAnalyzeRlist also contains results with p-values set to NA. (NA
  filter removed).  Furthemore the interpretation of design matrixes
  with regards to continous or discrete variables was improved.

- The vignette was updated all around including the FAQ sections:

- "What Quantification Tool(s) Should I Use?"

Changes in version 1.3.7:

- isoformSwitchTestDEXSeq() was updated to use testForDEU instead of
  nbinomLRT as now reccomended by the authors.

Changes in version 1.3.5:

- One-line summary: Improved robustness, usability and speed

- Main changes:

- isoformSwitchTestDEXSeq() is introduced as the new default test as it
  is a more robust and much more reliable test for differential isoform
  usage.

- The original isoformSwitchTest() is decommissioned due to it being
  inferior to both isoformSwitchTestDEXSeq() and
  isoformSwitchTestDRIMSeq() in most aspects.

- importIsoformExpression() now also support import of StringTie
  quantifications.

- updates that allows for better handling of Ensemble data.

- updates throughout the R package making IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR (much)
  faster and more reliable.

- Specifically the changes in inlcuded functions are:

- isoformSwitchTestDEXSeq() is introduced as the default switch isoform
  switch test function

- I handles the False Discovery Rate much better

- It allows for batch corrected effect size estimation

- It is a good deal faster (for smaller sample sizes)

- isoformSwitchTestDRIMSeq() was updated to handle continous
  co-variates.

- isoformSwitchTest() has been removed from the package since it is
  obsolte.

- The importRdata() now:

- Allows for import via either replicate abundance or replciate count
  data (or both - which is highly reccomended).

- These changes were reflected in createSwitchAnalyzeRlist()

- Test for full rank of experimental design

- The importCufflinksCummeRbund() and importCufflinksFiles() now also
  extract and replicate isoform abundance estimates.

- The functions importRdata(), importCufflinksCummeRbund() and
  importCufflinksFiles()

- Calculates isoform fractions based on the replicate isoform fraction
  matrix (instead based on average isoform and gene expression)
  providing more accurate estimataes.

- Was uptimized so they are more streamlined and faster.

- importGTF (also used by importRdata() ) was updated to handle the
  problems with version numbering in amongst other Ensembl data.

- To support the batch correction feature in isoformSwitchTestDEXSeq()
  the subsetSwitchAnalyzeRlist() function was modified so when
  subsetting in the the exon entry of the switchAnalyzeRList, as well
  as any replicate matrix entry (counts, abundances or isoform
  fractions), all isoforms from genes where at least one isoform passed
  the filters are kept.

- The isoformToIsoformFraction() - a general purpose function for
  calculateing Isoform Fraction (IFs) from isoform expression - are
  introduced

- The isoformToGeneExp() function was updated to be true general
  purpose (less stringent about data formating) and thanks to a
  tidyverse solution to the central problem is now between 2x-10x
  faster than previously (and becomses faster as the large the datasets
  are)

- createSwitchAnalyzeRlist() was updated to

- handle replicate data

- fix condition name problems

- test for full rank of design

- importIsoformExpression() was updated to:

- Support StringTie data.

- Perform the inter-library normalization after a lenient expression
  cutoff have beeen applied (to remove most very lowly expressed
  isoforms).

- Now uses the "scaledTPM" instead of "lengthScaledTPM" tximport option
  when imporitng with countsFromAbundance=TRUE The ignoreAfterBar
  argument from tximport() is now also supported.

- We introduce the removeAnnoationData() function which eables removal
  of biological sequence and/or the replicate quantification data from
  a switchAnalyzeRlist threby significantly removing the size.

- The default on the IFcutoff in switchPlot() and
  switchPlotTopSwitches() was updated to 0.05 which should result in
  cleaner plots (meaningisoforms only contributing minimally to the
  parent gene expression are now omitted from plot).

- Specifically the package maintenance changes are:

- All around speed improvements mainly due to updates regarding two
  bottelnecks:

- stringr::str_c replaces paste0 since it is up to 10x faster on
  data.frames

- dplyr::inner_join() or dplyr::left_join() have replaced most
  base::merge() opperations since since they are up to 10x faster.

- All documentation and examples are now based on Salmon data.
  Cufflinks is shown as a special case.

- For this switch new example data was included in the package.

- Directy suppor of Cufflinks/Cuffdiff files via the cummeRbund R
  package (via the importCufflinksCummeRbund function) have been
  removed. Use importCufflinksFiles() instead.

- analyzeSignalP, analyzePFAM, analyzeCPAT now better handles empty
  files.

- All documentation regarding PFAM was updated to use EBI's homepage
  (and their restrictions).

- Updated package title to reflect the introduction of the alternative
  splicing module

- A requirement for tximport >= 1.8.0 was introduced (due to problems
  with importing from RSEM in previous versions)

- Highligting that import of GTF files can be done from both unziped
  and gziped gtf files.

- Updated NEWS file to follow bioconductor style guideline

- Genral update to support condition (and covariate) names compatible
  with model building in R.

- All general support functions (potentially) used more than once place
  were moved to tool.R and names were streamlined.

- Various updates in vignette to reflect all changes desribed above as
  well as update of installation instructions.

- Various updates to input testing to catch commonly occuring problems.

- Correction of loads of spelling mistakes kindely pointed out by
  @afonsoguerra - thanks!

[tximeta](https://bioconductor.org/packages/tximeta)
-------

Changes in version 0.0.16:

- Added examples to all man pages.

[tximport](https://bioconductor.org/packages/tximport)
--------

Changes in version 1.9.11:

- Exporting simple internal function makeCountsFromAbundance().

Changes in version 1.9.10:

- Added 'infRepStat' argument which offers re-compution of counts and
  abundances using a function applied to the inferential replicates,
  e.g. matrixStats::rowMedian for using the median of posterior samples
  as the point estimate provided in "counts" and "abundance". If
  'countsFromAbundance' is specified, this will compute counts a second
  time from the re-computed abundances.

Changes in version 1.9.9:

- Adding support for gene-level summarization of inferential
  replicates. This takes place by perform row summarization on the
  inferential replicate (counts) in the same manner as the original
  counts (and optionally computing the variance).

Changes in version 1.9.6:

- Added new countsFromAbundance method: "dtuScaledTPM". This is
  designed for DTU analysis and to be used with txOut=TRUE. It provides
  counts that are scaled, with a gene, by the median transcript length
  among isoforms, then later by the sample's sequencing depth, as in
  the other two methods. The transcript lengths are calculated by first
  taking the average across samples. With this new method, all the
  abundances within a gene across all samples are scaled up by the same
  length, preserving isoform proportions calculated from the counts.

Changes in version 1.9.4:

- Made a change to summarizeToGene() that will now provide different
  output with a warning to alert the user. The case is: if tximport()
  is run with countsFromAbundance="scaledTPM" or "lengthScaledTPM" and
  txOut=TRUE, followed by summarizeToGene() with
  countsFromAbundance="no". This is a problematic series of calls, and
  previously it was ignoring the fact that the incoming counts are not
  original counts. Now, summarizeToGene() will throw a warning and
  override countsFromAbundance="no" to instead set it to the value that
  was used when tximport was originally run, either "scaledTPM" or
  "lengthScaledTPM".

Changes in version 1.9.1:

- Fixed edgeR example code in vignette to use scaleOffset after
  recommendation from Aaron Lun (2018-05-25).
