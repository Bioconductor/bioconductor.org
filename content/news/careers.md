<h2 id="SAPII" />SYSTEMS ANALYST PROGRAMMER  II</h2>

The [Bioconductor][] project seeks a creative
and motivated individual to join our bioinformatics team. Bioconductor
develops and distributes open-source, open-development software for
analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data from
sequencing and other sources. Bioconductor is based on the R language
for statistical analysis, with more than 670 software packages
developed internally and by our vibrant user community.

SCOPE OF RESPONSIBILITIES

This unique opportunity emphasizes scientific computing software
development. The applicant will work under immediate technical
direction. The applicant will develop and maintain algorithms and data
representations for use by our vibrant user community. The applicant
will become and maintain familiarity with the bioinformatic needs of
our users. The applicant will have responsibility for implementing
software packages in specific domains of application, and will share
responsibility with other team members for routine maintenance of our
large base of existing and user-contributed packages.

MAJOR DUTIES

This position involves software development, primarily related to
annotation and analysis of high-throughput sequence data using R /
Bioconductor tools. The applicant will write robust R code for
efficiently organizing and processing large volumes of sequence and
annotation data. The applicant will have responsibility for
implementing cloud-based data management solutions that integrate with
the R environment. The applicant will participate in our Agile-like
development process. The applicant will also participate in
Bioconductor activities involved with user interaction: technical
support contact through our mailing list; evaluation of new
user-contributed packages; and training courses / annual conferences.

MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS

1. Bachelor’s degree with one year of experience in biostatistics,
   computer science, bioinformatics, or related disciplines.
2. Familiarity with programming languages, especially C and R.
3. High-level familiarity with modern web services implementations.
4. Familiarity with statistical concepts and methods.
5. Experience with software development best practices, for instance
   use of version control, unit tests, agile project management, and
   creation of end-user documentation.

Recommended qualifications include:

1. Ability to implement reusable, user-directed software.
2. Familiarity with managing high-volume genetic data, such as from
   next-generation sequence pipelines, and with relevant public
   annotation resources.
3. Familiarity with and enthusiasm for diverse programming languages
   and paradigms.
4. Enthusiasm for molecular biological processes.
5. Familiarity with bioinformatic work flows.
