  transcription factor ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, DNase-seq etc. The
  functions in the package can be used with any type of data that can
  be represented with bigwig files at any resolution. The goal of the
  ALPS is to provide analysis tools for most downstream analysis
  without leaving the R environment and most tools in the package
  require a minimal input that can be prepared with basic R, unix or
  excel skills.

- [APAlyzer](https://bioconductor.org/packages/APAlyzer) Perform
  3'UTR APA, Intronic APA and gene expression analysis using RNA-seq
  data.

  single cell RNA-seq reads in fastq files into gene count or
  transcript compatibility counts (TCC) matrices for downstream
  analysis. Central to this pipeline is the barcode, UMI, and set
  (BUS) file format. This package serves the following purposes:
  First, this package allows users to manipulate BUS format files as
  data frames in R and then convert them into gene count or TCC
  matrices. Furthermore, since R and Rcpp code is easier to handle
  than pure C++ code, users are encouraged to tweak the source code
  of this package to experiment with new uses of BUS format and
  different ways to convert the BUS file into gene count matrix.
  Second, this package can conveniently generate files required to
  generate gene count matrices for spliced and unspliced transcripts
  for RNA velocity. Third, this package implements utility functions
  to get transcripts and associated genes required to convert BUS
  files to gene count matrices, to write the transcript to gene
  information in the format required by bustools, and to read output
  of bustools into R as sparses matrices.

  fully unsupervised deconvolution of complex tissues. It provides
  basic functions to perform unsupervised deconvolution on mixture
  expression profiles by Convex Analysis of Mixtures (CAM) and some
  auxiliary functions to help understand the subpopulation-specific
  results. It also implements functions to perform supervised
  deconvolution based on prior knowledge of molecular markers, S

  significant changes in the interaction counts between the data from
  two cell types or two treatments.

- [DEWSeq](https://bioconductor.org/packages/DEWSeq) Differential
  expression analysis of windows for next-generation sequencing data
  like eCLIP or iCLIP data.

- [DMCFB](https://bioconductor.org/packages/DMCFB) DMCFB is a
  pipeline for identifying differentially methylated cytosines using
  a Bayesian functional regression model in bisulfite sequencing
  data. By using a functional regression data model, it tries to
  capture position-specific, group-specific and other
  covariates-specific methylation patterns as well as spatial
  correlation patterns and unknown underlying models of methylation
  data. It is robust and flexible with respect to the true underlying
  models and inclusion of any covariates, and the missing values are
  imputed using spatial correlation between positions and samples. A
  Bayesian approach is adopted for estimation and inference in the
  proposed method.

- [fcoex](https://bioconductor.org/packages/fcoex) The fcoex package
  implements an easy-to use interface to co-expression analysisbased
  on the FCBF (Fast Correlation-Based Filter) algorithm. it was
  implemented especifically to deal with single-cell data. The
  modules found can be used to redefine cell populations, unrevel
  novel gene associations and predict gene function by
  guilt-by-association. The package structure is based on the
  CEMiTool package.

- [fcScan](https://bioconductor.org/packages/fcScan) This package is
  used to detect combination of genomic coordinates falling within a
  user defined window size along with user defined overlap between
  identified neighboring clusters. It can be used for genomic data

  strand. Clustering can be performed with a "greedy" option allowing
  thus the presence of additional sites within the allowed window
  size.

- [flowSpecs](https://bioconductor.org/packages/flowSpecs) This
  package is intended to fill the role of conventional cytometry
  pre-processing software, for spectral decomposition,
  transformation, visualization and cleanup, and to aid further
  downstream analyses, such as with DepecheR, by enabling
  transformation of flowFrames and flowSets to dataframes. Functions
  for flowCore-compliant automatic 1D-gating/filtering are in the
  pipe line. The package name has been chosen both as it will deal
  with spectral cytometry and as it will hopefully give the user a
  nice pair of spectacles through which to view their data.

- [flowSpy](https://bioconductor.org/packages/flowSpy) A trajectory
  inference and visualization toolkit for flow and mass cytometry
  data. flowSpy offers complete analyzing workflow for flow and mass
  cytometry data. flowSpy can be a valuable tool for application
  ranging from clustering and dimensionality reduction to trajectory

  log-fold changes to model sample-dependent and independent effects,
  and uses a variational Bayes approach to infer these effects. The
  inferred effects are used to score and identify genetic
  interactions, such as lethality and recovery. More details can be
  found in Zamanighomi et al. 2019 (in press).

- [GenomicOZone](https://bioconductor.org/packages/GenomicOZone) The
  package clusters gene activity along chromosome into zones, detects
  differential zones as outstanding, and visualizes maps of

  peaks.

- [IgGeneUsage](https://bioconductor.org/packages/IgGeneUsage)
  Decoding the properties of immune repertoires is key in
  understanding the response of adaptive immunity to challenges such
  as viral infection. One important task in immune repertoire
  profiling is the detection of biases in Ig gene usage between
  biological conditions. IgGeneUsage is a computational tool for the
  analysis of differential gene usage in immune repertoires. It
  employs Bayesian hierarchical models to fit complex gene usage data
  from immune repertoire sequencing experiments and quantifies Ig
  gene usage biases as probabilities.

- [KnowSeq](https://bioconductor.org/packages/KnowSeq) KnowSeq
  proposes a whole pipeline that comprises the most relevant steps in
  the RNA-seq gene expression analysis, with the main goal of
  extracting biological knowledge from raw data (Differential
  Expressed Genes, Gene Ontology enrichment, pathway visualization
  and related diseases). In this sense, KnowSeq allows aligning raw
  data from the original fastq or sra files, by using the most
  renowned aligners such as tophat2, hisat2, salmon and kallisto.
  Nowadays, there is no package that only from the information of the
  samples to align -included in a text file-, automatically performs
  the download and alignment of all of the samples. Furthermore, the
  package includes functions to: calculate the gene expression
  values; remove batch effect; calculate the Differentially Expressed
  Genes (DEGs); plot different graphs; and perform the DEGs
  enrichment with the GO information, pathways visualization and
  related diseases information retrieval. Moreover, KnowSeq is the
  only package that allows applying both a machine learning and DEGs
  enrichment processes just after the DEGs extraction. This idea
  emerged with the aim of proposing a complete tool to the research
  community containing all the necessary steps to carry out complete
  studies in a simple and fast way.

- [LinkHD](https://bioconductor.org/packages/LinkHD) Here we present
  Link-HD, an approach to integrate heterogeneous datasets, as a
  generalization of STATIS-ACT (“Structuration des Tableaux A Trois
  Indices de la Statistique–Analyse Conjointe de Tableaux”), a family
  of methods to join and compare information from multiple subspaces.
  However, STATIS-ACT has some drawbacks since it only allows
  continuous data and it is unable to establish relationships between
  samples and features. In order to tackle these constraints, we
  incorporate multiple distance options and a linear regression based
  Biplot model in order to stablish relationships between
  observations and variable and perform variable selection.

- [lionessR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/lionessR) LIONESS, or
  Linear Interpolation to Obtain Network Estimates for Single
  Samples, can be used to reconstruct single-sample networks
  (https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06440). This code implements the
  LIONESS equation in the lioness function in R to reconstruct
  single-sample networks. The default network reconstruction method
  we use is based on Pearson correlation. However, lionessR can run
  on any network reconstruction algorithms that returns a complete,
  weighted adjacency matrix. lionessR works for both unipartite and
  bipartite networks.

- [Maaslin2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/Maaslin2) MaAsLin2 is
  comprehensive R package for efficiently determining multivariable
  association between clinical metadata and microbial meta'omic
  features. MaAsLin2 relies on general linear models to accommodate

- [MBQN](https://bioconductor.org/packages/MBQN) Modified quantile
  normalization for omics or other matrix-like data distorted in
  location and scale.

- [MEB](https://bioconductor.org/packages/MEB) Identifying
  differential expression genes between the same or different species
  is an urgent demand for biological research. In most of cases,
  normalization is the first step to solve this problem, then by
  employing the hypothesis testing, we could detect statistically
  significant genes. With the development of machine learning, it
  gives us a new perspective on discrimination between differential
  expression (DE) and non-differential expression (non-DE) genes.
  Provided a set of training data, the procedure of distinguishing
  genes could be simplified as a classification problem. However, in
  reality, it is hard for us to get the information from both DE and
  non-DE genes. To solve this problem, we try to identify
  differential cases only in the domain of non-DE genes, and
  transform the problem to an outlier detection in machine learning.
  Given that non-DE genes have some similarities in features, we
  build a Minimum Enclosing Ball (MEB) to cover those non-DE genes in
  feature space, then those DE genes, which are enormously different
  from non-DE genes, being regarded as outliers and rejected outside
  the ball. Compared with existing methods, it is no need for the MEB
  method to normalize data in advance. Besides, the MEB method could
  be easily applied to the same or different species data and without
  changing too much.

- [MetaVolcanoR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/MetaVolcanoR) This
  package combines differential gene expression results. It
  implements three strategies to summarize differential gene
  expression from different studies. i) Random Effects Model (REM)

  novel permutation filtering approach designed to address two
  unsolved problems in microbiome data processing: (i) define and
  quantify loss due to filtering by implementing thresholds, and (ii)
  introduce and evaluate a permutation test for filtering loss to
  provide a measure of excessive filtering.

- [PhyloProfile](https://bioconductor.org/packages/PhyloProfile)
  PhyloProfile is a tool for exploring complex phylogenetic profiles.
  Phylogenetic profiles, presence/absence patterns of genes over a
  set of species, are commonly used to trace the functional and
  evolutionary history of genes across species and time. With
  PhyloProfile we can enrich regular phylogenetic profiles with
  further data like sequence/structure similarity, to make
  phylogenetic profiling more meaningful. Besides the interactive
  visualisation powered by R-Shiny, the package offers a set of
  further analysis features to gain insights like the gene age

  associated changes in gene expression using the most comprehensive
  database of published quantitative trait loci (QTLs).

- [ReactomeGSA](https://bioconductor.org/packages/ReactomeGSA) The
  ReactomeGSA packages uses Reactome's online analysis service to
  perform a multi-omics gene set analysis. The main advantage of this
  package is, that the retrieved results can be visualized using
  REACTOME's powerful webapplication. Since Reactome's analysis
  service also uses R to perfrom the actual gene set analysis you
  will get similar results when using the same packages (such as
  limma and edgeR) locally. Therefore, if you only require a gene set
  analysis, different packages are more suited.

- [RNAmodR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/RNAmodR) RNAmodR

  high throughput sequencing data.

- [RNAsense](https://bioconductor.org/packages/RNAsense) RNA-sense
  tool compares RNA-seq time curves in two experimental conditions,
  i.e. wild-type and mutant, and works in three steps. At Step 1, it
  builds expression profile for each transcript in one condition
  (i.e. wild-type) and tests if the transcript abundance grows or
  decays significantly.  Dynamic transcripts are then sorted to
  non-overlapping groups (time profiles) by the time point of switch
  up or down. At Step 2, RNA-sense outputs the groups of
  differentially expressed transcripts, which are up- or
  downregulated in the mutant compared to the wild-type at each time
  point. At Step 3, Correlations (Fisher's exact test) between the
  outputs of Step 1 (switch up- and switch down- time profile groups)
  and the outputs of Step2 (differentially expressed transcript
  groups) are calculated. The results of the correlation analysis are

  imbalance. The implementation is based on the original SAIGE R
  package (v0.29.4.4). SAIGEgds also implements some of the SPAtest
  functions in C to speed up the calculation of Saddlepoint
  approximation. Benchmarks show that SAIGEgds is 5 to 6 times faster
  than the original SAIGE R package.

- [SBGNview](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SBGNview) SBGNview is

  from SBGN-ML files. SBGNview can map a large collection of gene,
  protein and compound ID typs to glyphs.

- [SCANVIS](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SCANVIS) SCANVIS is a
  set of annotation-dependent tools for analyzing splice junctions
  and their read support as predetermined by an alignment tool of
  choice (for example, STAR aligner). SCANVIS assesses each
  junction's relative read support (RRS) by relating to the context
  of local split reads aligning to annotated transcripts. SCANVIS
  also annotates each splice junction by indicating whether the
  junction is supported by annotation or not, and if not, what type
  of junction it is (e.g. exon skipping, alternative 5' or 3' events,
  Novel Exons). Unannotated junctions are also futher annotated by
  indicating whether it induces a frame shift or not. SCANVIS
  includes a visualization function to generate static sashimi-style
  plots depicting relative read support and number of split reads
  using arc thickness and arc heights, making it easy for users to
  spot well-supported junctions. These plots also clearly delineate
  unannotated junctions from annotated ones using designated color
  schemes, and users can also highlight splice junctions of choice.
  Variants and/or a read profile are also incoroporated into the plot
  if the user supplies variants in bed format and/or the BAM file.
  One further feature of the visualization function is that users can
  submit multiple samples of a certain disease or cohort to generate
  a single plot - this occurs via a "merge" function wherein junction
  details over multiple samples are merged to generate a single
  sashimi plot, which is useful when contrasting cohorots (eg.
  disease vs control).

[BASiCS](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BASiCS)
------

                 Changes in version 1.7.20 (2019-10-17)                 

- Bumps version number to trigger new build.

                 Changes in version 1.7.19 (2019-10-08)                 

- BASiCS_TestDE now checks to ensure that both input chains have been
  run with Regression = FALSE or both with Regression = TRUE.

- Remove duplicated text from `BASiCS_Chain`'s show method.

                 Changes in version 1.7.18 (2019-10-06)                 

- Refactor HVG/LVG plots code to use `ggplot2`.  When calling
  `BASiCS_DetectHVG` or `BASiCS_DetectLVG`, the plots are now stored in
  the returned list in the named element `Plots`. The vignette has been
  updated to show the usage of this functionality.

- In all unit tests: use `expect_equal(foo, bar)` instead of
  `expect_true(all.equal(foo, bar))`. This gives better printing (ie,
  if it's not true it tells by what margin)

- Rename some functions for consistency in capitalisation. For example,
  `BASiCS_showFit` has been deprecated and renamed to `BASiCS_ShowFit`.

- Add a `Smooth` argument to `BASiCS_DiagPlot`.

- BASiCS_TestDE is now explicit about requiring the same number of
  samples in both chains. Previously it would fail due to arrays of
  non-conformable dimensions.

- Add some internal utility functions.

- Remove exportPattern("^[^\\Hidden]") meaning functions must be
  explicitly exported using roxygen tags.

                 Changes in version 1.7.17 (2019-10-04)                 

- Minor change in `newBASiCS_Data` to avoid missing `colnames` when
  adding `colData`

- New unit test to verify that `colnames` are not lost

                 Changes in version 1.7.16 (2019-10-04)                 

- Minor changes to NAMESPACE to pass R CMD Check

                 Changes in version 1.7.15 (2019-09-30)                 

- Swtich from `matrixStats` dependency to `Matrix` as it supports more
  general input classes (including sparse matrices)

- `newBASiCS_Data` now requires input counts to be a `matrix`.

                 Changes in version 1.7.14 (2019-09-27)                 

- Changed internal functions from `matrixStats` to `Matrix` to support
  more classes of matrix (eg, `dgCMatrix`). BASiCS_MCMC now supports
  DelayedArray, dgEMatrix, dgCMatrix objects and likely more.

                 Changes in version 1.7.13 (2019-09-25)                 

- Updated unit tests to account for new default choice for `min.mean`
  parameter in `scran::computeSumFactors`

- New unit test to check for changes in `scran::computeSumFactors`

                 Changes in version 1.7.12 (2019-09-15)                 

- changes maintainer's email address

                 Changes in version 1.7.11 (2019-09-15)                 

- `Uncertainty` parameter added to `BASiCS_showFit`. This enables
  optional inclusion of uncertainty measure around the regression
  trend.

- Re-ordering of parameter in c++ MCMC samplers (does not affect
  output)

- Avoid unnecessary transformations between NumericMatrix/Vector and
  arma::

- Removes `isSpike` usage in `BASiCS_Sim` documentation

- Removes `isSpike` call from the vignette

- Adds missing parameters to the documentation of
  `BASiCS_CorrectOffset`

                       Changes in version 1.7.10                        

- `metadata(Data)$SpikeInput` is now required to be a `data.frame`.
  This allows us to verify the correct order in spike-in inputs when
  the user manually modifies an existing `SingleCellExperiment` object.

- Additional changes in `newBASiCS_Data`,
  `HiddenBASiCS_MCMC_InputCheck`, `HiddenChecksBASiCS_Data` to avoid
  errors.

- `HiddenBASiCS_MCMC_Start`, `HiddenBASiCS_MCMC_GlobalParams`,
  `BASiCS_DenoisedCounts` and `BASiCS_DenoisedRates` modified to
  replace `isSpike` by `altExp`

                 Changes in version 1.7.8 (2019-08-20)                  

- `min.mean` parameter exposed in `BASiCS_CorrectOffset` and
  `BASiCS_TestDE`

                 Changes in version 1.7.7 (2019-08-20)                  

- Preliminary version of `BASiCS_CorrectOffset` has been added. This
  includes a trimmed option for the offset calculation that excludes
  lowly expressed genes. This is similar to what is implemented in
  `scran:::.rescale_clusters

                 Changes in version 1.7.6 (2019-08-19)                  

- Offset correction within `BASiCS_TestDE` modified to use `rowMedians`
  instead of `rowSums2`. This makes it more robust to outlier genes.

- Unit tests updated accordingly.

                 Changes in version 1.7.5 (2019-07-30)                  

- Returns to original updates for X (fixed after burn-in)

                 Changes in version 1.7.4 (2019-07-30)                  

- Show method for regression objects now correctly shows number of
  cells.

- `HiddenBASiCS_MCMCcppReg` and `HiddenBASiCS_MCMCcppRegNoSpikes` (C++
  code) modified to update design matrix throughout MCMC (GRBF
  locations remain fixed after the burn-in period is over)

- Unit tests updated accordingly.

                 Changes in version 1.7.3 (2019-07-29)                  

- Minor typo fixed in `BASiCS_MCMC`.

                 Changes in version 1.7.2 (2019-07-28)                  

- Specific minimum tolerance thresholds (e.g. 1e-3 for mu updates)
  replaced by global parameters (e.g. `mintol_mu`). Optional
  parameters; internal use only.  Incorporated within
  `HiddenBASiCS_MCMC_ExtraArgs`.

- General clean up to remove code redundancy in `BASiCS_MCMC`

- `HiddenBASiCS_MCMC_GlobalParams` created to facilitate clean-up above

                 Changes in version 1.7.1 (2019-07-27)                  

- `is_true` deprecated in `testthat`. Unit tests updated to use
  `expect_true`

[batchelor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/batchelor)
---------

                        Changes in version 1.2.0

  fastMNN() and mnnCorrect(). Automatic merging now detects potential
  tree-based merges. Merge trees can also be specified as input.

- Added the correctExperiments() function to cbind the original assays
  alongside the merged values.

- Added the subset.row= argument to cosineNorm() for in-place
  subsetting.

- Added batch= and preserve.single= arguments to multiBatchNorm().
  Standardized behavior of subset.row= by adding a normalize.all=
  argument.

- Added the regressBatches() function for correction via standard
  linear regression.

- Added the prop.k= argument in all MNN-related functions, to allow the
  value of k to adapt asymmetrically to the size of each batch.

--------

                Changes in version 0.99.25 (2019-09-11)                 

- Added message to indicate when get_velocity_files is extracting
exon-exon junctions.  - Restored "separate" to be default
isoform_action in get_velocity_files.

                Changes in version 0.99.24 (2019-09-06)                 

- When sorting tr2g from file, now the file must be formatted in ways
required by bustools.

                Changes in version 0.99.23 (2019-09-06)                 

- Previous two version bumps did not accompany changes; those were
used to trigger rebuilds on Bioconductor.  - Added the functionality
to use L-1 (L is read length) bases around exon-exon junction to
better distinguish between spliced and unspliced transcripts for RNA
velocity.  - Fixed serious problem with get_velocity_file that
counted reads mapping to exons of length between L-1 and 2(L-1) as
from unspliced transcript. This was done by an reimplementation of
the method to get flanked intronic ranges.  - Changed default
isoform_action to "collapse".  - Make sure that all transcripts in
tr2g.tsv from get_velocity_files are in the transcriptome.

                Changes in version 0.99.20 (2019-08-26)

[CAGEfightR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/CAGEfightR)
----------

- Added citation to BMC Bioinformatics paper.

                         Changes in version 1.5                         

- Added new functions for spatial analysis of clusters: findLinks finds
  nearby pairs of clusters (for example TSSs and enhancers) and
  calculates the correlation of expression between them. findStretches
  find stretches along the genome where clusters are within a certain
  distance of eachother (for example groups of enhancer forming a super
  enhancer) and calculates the average pairwise correlation between
  members.

- Changed the way clustering works: CAGEfightR uses coverage() to
  calculate genome-wide signals and now rounds the resulting signal to
  a certain number of digits (this can be modified via the
  CAGEfightR.round option), to prevent small positive or negative
  values due to floating point errors. This makes clustering more
  stable meaning the tuneTagClustering function is now deprecated. This
  should also increase the speed of most functions.

- CAGEfightR now uses GPos instead of GRanges for storing CTSSs, this
  should result in improved memory performance.

- Several changes to clusterBidirectionality: Balance is now calculated
  using the midpoint as well (preventing some rare cases where the
  midpoint could mask a single highly expressed CTSS), the pooled CTSS
  signal is now prefiltered for bidirectionality to increase speed and
  custom balance function can be provided (Bhattacharyya coefficient
  and Andersson's D are included).

- Added new check-functions to make it easier to check if objects are
  formatted correctly

----

                 Changes in version 1.8.0 (2019-10-28)                  

New Features

- Optimization has led obtainOneStudy() and obtainMultipleStudies()

  it is generally slower: Due to inconsistancy in the terms that cgdsr
  uses, AvailableData() has to check the availability of the data at
  two different levels.

from files when using file paths as arguments of
prepareCMapPerturbations() - Significantly decrease memory required
to use cTRAP by loading chunks of z-scores from CMap perturbations

prepareCMapPerturbations() is run with argument loadZscores = TRUE -
Display summary of loaded perturbations after running
prepareCMapPerturbations() - Improve ranking of similar perturbations
(rankSimilarPerturbation()): - Redesigned output: long (instead of
wide) table - By default, calculate mean across cell lines if there
is more than one cell line available; disabled if argument
cellLineMean = FALSE - Allow to rank (or not) individual cell line
perturbations (argument rankIndividualCellLinePerturbations) when the
mean is calculated - Allow to perform multiple comparison methods if
desired (by providing a vector of supported methods via the method
argument) - Calculate the rank product's rank to assess ranks across
multiple methods - Sort results based on rank product's rank (or the
rank of the only comparison method performed, otherwise) - Include
information for calculated means across cell lines in metadata -

similarPerturbations object, obtained after running
rankSimilarPerturbations(): - Show further metadata information
(including compound data, if available) related with a given
perturbation by calling print() with a similarPerturbations object
and a specific perturbation identifier - Show a complete table with
metadata (and compound information, if available) when calling
as.table() with a similarPerturbations object - Improve plotting
(plot()): - Plot comparison results against all compared data by
calling plot() with the results obtained after running
rankSimilarPerturbations() or predictTargetingDrugs(); non-ranked
compared data can also be plotted with argument
plotNonRankedPerturbations = TRUE - Render scatter and Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) plots between differential expression
results and a single perturbation by calling plot() with a
perturbationChanges object (if an identifier regarding the summary of
multiple perturbations scores across cell lines is given, the plots
are coloured by cell line) - When displaying GSEA plots, plot results
for most up- and down-regulated user-provided differentially
expressed genes (by default) - Improve GSEA plot style, including rug
plot in enrichment score plot (replacing the gene hit plot)

Bug fixes and minor changes

- CMap metadata minor improvements: - Improve list returned by

[derfinder](https://bioconductor.org/packages/derfinder)
---------

                       Changes in version 1.19.9                        

BUG FIXES

- Fixed an important bug in findRegions() that affected the end
positions of the regions when maxRegionGap was supplied with a value
greater than the default of 0 and the data was filtered (so position
was not all TRUE in the findRegions() call). To check this scenario
now there is a new unit test under
tests/testthat/test-maxRegionGap.R.  - The above bug went unnoticed
in getRegionCoverage() and thus for regionMatrix() for the same type
of situations (filtered data with a non-zero maxRegionGap). The
coverage values are ok, it's just the end positions of the regions
returned by findRegions() that were incorrect and that would need to
be re-computed with the fixed version.  - Changed some internal tests
to check bumphunter::loessByCluster() instead of
bumphunter::runmedByCluster() given some issues with the second one.

                       Changes in version 1.19.8                        

- Added a NEWS.md file to track changes to the package.

                       Changes in version 1.19.4                        

BUG FIXES

- railMatrix() and loadCoverage() helper functions had an issue when
the input set of regions was duplicated. This could be reproduced
with

sampleFile <- c('SRR387777' =
'http://duffel.rail.bio/recount/SRP009615/bw/SRR387777.bw') regs <-
GenomicRanges::GRanges('chrY', IRanges(start = c(1, 1), width = 10),
strand = '-') names(regs) <- c(1:2) result <-
rtracklayer::import(sampleFile, selection = regs, as = 'RleList')

This error affected recount and other reverse dependencies that use
derfinder for processing BigWig files.

                       Changes in version 1.19.2                        

BUG FIXES

- railMatrix() and loadCoverage() helper functions now attempt to
import a BigWig file 3 times before giving up. Based on
http://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/web-query/ and
https://github.com/leekgroup/recount/commit/8da982b309e2d19638166f263057d9f85bb64e3f
which will make these functions more robust to occasional web access
issues.

[derfinderHelper](https://bioconductor.org/packages/derfinderHelper)
---------------

                       Changes in version 1.19.3                        

- Added a NEWS.md file to track changes to the package.

[derfinderPlot](https://bioconductor.org/packages/derfinderPlot)
-------------

                       Changes in version 1.19.3

[DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/DESeq2)
------

                       Changes in version 1.26.0                        

- Incorporation of fast code from Constantin Ahlmann-Eltze which speeds
  up DESeq2 for large sample sizes (n > 100) by at least an order of
  magnitude. In fact the speed is now linear with number of samples
  whereas previously DESeq2 would scale quadratically. The critical
  merge commits were: c96c1c0ad43280c82403d3e6bc3501332a62e7b8
  (2019-07-16) 0a47a0c750aa5c31df759a171c737d6ed782d6c2 (2019-07-30)

- Fixed a bug where rbind() in parallel=TRUE would proliferate metadata
  items.

- Updated vignette to discuss tximeta (workflow also updated to show
  use of tximeta instead of read counting).

[DEWSeq](https://bioconductor.org/packages/DEWSeq)
------

                 Changes in version 0.99.0 (2019-09-23)

[DMRcate](https://bioconductor.org/packages/DMRcate)
-------

                        Changes in version 2.0.0                        

- Full utility for WGBS and RRBS assays implemented using
  sequencing.annotate(): Users can either input a) A BSseq object and
  model matrix from edgeR::modelMatrixMeth, or b) Output from
  DSS::DMLtest() or DSS::DMLtest.multiFactor(),

- Major reconstruction of class types in S4: a S3 "annot" object is now
  a S4 "CpGannotated" object and a S3 "dmrcate.output" object has had
  its "input" and "pcutoff" slots removed, and "results" are now
  represented in an S4

- Improved DMR.plot() using more detailed transcript annotation from
  hg19, hg38 and mm10 GeneRegionTracks from updated DMRcatedata, as
  well as smoothed group means (group specified via "phen.col"
  argument). For bisulfite sequencing assays, the CpGs argument now
  takes a BSseq object instead of a GRanges object

- Extra DMR-level summary statistics including Fisher's multiple
  comparison test and harmonic mean of individual CpG FDRs

- Addition of the changeFDR() utility function that allows the
  re-thresholding of a "CpGannotated" object without fitting the entire
  model again

- Simplification of the rmSNPandCH() function

- Overlapping.promoters in extractRanges() are now overlapping.genes

- All vignette examples use ExperimentHub data

- Extra data object from DMRcatedata needed for rmSNPandCH(),
  extractRanges() and DMR.plot() are now in ExperimentHub

- Removal of the "p.adjust.method" argument to dmrcate() - it is
  confusing since thresholding should be performed at the
  (cpg|sequencing).annotate level

- Removal of the "samps" argument to DMR.plot() - it is redundant and
  usage can be specified by subsetting "CpGs" and "phen.col"

- Multicore processing removed since WGBS DMRs should be able to be
  produced in serial in < 1 hour

[DominoEffect](https://bioconductor.org/packages/DominoEffect)
------------

                        Changes in version 1.5.2

- ignore universe and print a waring message if users passing
accidentally passing wrong input (2019-10-24, Thu) -
https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/clusterProfiler/issues/217 - gene with
minimal ES value (NES < 0) will be reported in core_enrichment
(2019-07-31, Wed)

                       Changes in version 3.11.1                        

- build_Anno now compatible with tibble (2019-05-28, Tue)

[DropletUtils](https://bioconductor.org/packages/DropletUtils)
------------

                        Changes in version 1.8.0                        

- Added the downsampleBatches() function for convenient downsampling of
  batches.

                        Changes in version 1.6.0                        

- Switched emptyDrops() to use Boost's discrete_distribution for
  weighted sampling.  This results in some minor stochastic changes to
  the Monte Carlo p-values. Automatically round non-integer count
  matrices.

[edgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/edgeR)
-----

                       Changes in version 3.28.0                        

- Add head() and tail() methods for edgeR classes.

- Remove the 'mixed.df' argument and add a 'locfit.mixed' option to
  'trend.method' in estimateDisp() and WLEB().

- Add two new arguments 'large.n' and 'min.prop' to filterByExpr() to
  allow users to change parameters previously hard-wired.

- Remove 'values' and 'col' arguments to plotMD.DGELRT() and
  plotMD.ExactTest() as no longer needed because of changes to
  plotWithHighlights().

- roast.DGEList() and mroast.DGEList() now pass the 'nrot' argument to
  roast.default().

- Rename dglmStdResid() to plotMeanVar2().

- getDispersions() is no longer exported.

- Estimated dispersions are now numeric even if NA.

- Bug fix to goana.DGELRT() and kegga.DGELRT() when the LRT was on more
  than 1 df.

[EnhancedVolcano](https://bioconductor.org/packages/EnhancedVolcano)
---------------

                         Changes in version 1.4                         

- modified behaviour where a p-value of 0 is found: now converts these
  to 10^-1 * lowest non-zero p-value

- added new paremeter 'legendLabels', which allows user to use
  expressions in the legend label

- added support for tibbles

- transcriptPointSize, transcriptLabSize, transcriptLabCol,
  transcriptLabFace, transcriptLabhjust, and transcriptLabvjust now
  deprecated. Use pointSize, labSize, labCol, labFace, labhjust, and
  labvjust, respectively, instead

- pointSize default changed to 2.0

- boxedlabels now deprecated. Use boxedLabels

[enrichplot](https://bioconductor.org/packages/enrichplot)

[ExperimentHub](https://bioconductor.org/packages/ExperimentHub)
-------------

                       Changes in version 1.11.0                        

NEW FEATURES

- (1.11.2) system environment variable to control localHub option for
  creating hub based only on previously downloaded resources

- (1.11.5) With change in AnnotationHub. All force redownload of Hub
  sqlite file with refreshHub

BUG FIXES

- (1.11.2) Fix localHub when no internet connection.  The internal use
  of isDevel was preventing Hub creation when no internet connection.
  Fixed by checking connection. This code pretained to orgDb filters

[FamAgg](https://bioconductor.org/packages/FamAgg)
------

                       Changes in version 1.13.1                        

- Parameters id.col, father.col, mother.col, family.col and sex.col for
  FAData allow now to specify the column names for the respective
  content also if a data.frame is provided.

[fcScan](https://bioconductor.org/packages/fcScan)
------

                        Changes in version 0.99                         

- Fixing bugs and preparing for submission

[FELLA](https://bioconductor.org/packages/FELLA)
-----

                        Changes in version 1.5.3                        

- Changed `buildDataFromGraph()` so that it looks for organismal
  annotations in `keggInfo()`.

- If `ncbi-geneid` was not available, `buildDataFromGraph()` would
  crash with 404. Now, it can use `ncbi-proteinid` if `ncbi-geneid` is
  missing.

- Discovered by LY by building db for `"cvi"`

- Small update on `sanitise()`

                        Changes in version 1.4.2                        

- **The REST KEGG service changed and modules are no longer listable by
  organism**. `FELLA` now chooses modules that have at least one
  organismal gene. This seems equivalent to picking the modules from
  `keggLink("genome", "module")`, but the latter is slow (90s).

                        Changes in version 1.4.1                        

- Fixed bug in vignette due to changes in `biomaRt`

[fgsea](https://bioconductor.org/packages/fgsea)
-----

                       Changes in version 1.11.2                        

- Simpler handling of conditional probabilities

- Added the exact algorithm to inst folder

                       Changes in version 1.11.1                        

- Proper absEps handling

[fishpond](https://bioconductor.org/packages/fishpond)
--------

                        Changes in version 1.2.0                        

- Switching to a faster version of Swish which only computes the ranks
  of the data once, and then re-uses this for the permutation
  distribution. This bypasses the addition of uniform noise per
  permutation and is 10x faster. Two designs which still require
  re-computation of ranks per permutation are the paired analysis and
  the general interaction analysis. Two-group, stratified two-group,
  and the paired interaction analysis now default to the new fast
  method, but the original, slower method can be used by setting fast=0
  in the call to swish().

- Adding Rcpp-based function readEDS() written by Avi Srivastava which
  imports the sparse counts stored in Alevin's Efficient Data Storage
  (EDS) format.

- Changed the vignette so that it (will) use a linkedTxome, as sometime
  the build would break if the Bioc build machine couldn't access
  ftp.ebi.ac.uk.

- Add 'computeInfRV' function. InfRV is not used in the Swish methods,
  only for visualization purposes in the Swish paper.

- removed 'samr' from Imports, as it required source installation,
  moved to Suggests, for optional qvalue calculation

[flowcatchR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/flowcatchR)
----------

                       Changes in version 1.20.0

                 Changes in version 0.99.2 (2019-09-18)                 

- Diminishing the size of the example data, to fit all size
  requirements.

                 Changes in version 0.99.1 (2019-09-18)                 

- Version change, to suit BioConductor.

                 Changes in version 0.9.2 (2019-09-17)                  

- Formal tests included for all user functions.

- Using specMatCalc with one color is deprecated.

                 Changes in version 0.9.1 (2019-09-16)                  

- The name "flowSpecs" is introduced.

- The older "theFlowSpec" is from now on deprecated.

- All GCSscore probe packages are now automatically generated from
  Bioconductor sources (platform design (pd) and annotation (.db)
  packages) by using the makeProbePackage() function from the
  'AnnotationForge' package.  These are generated and installed based
  on the chip-type being analyzed by the end user on an as-needed
  basis.  NEW FEATURES

- Initial release of R package.

  "vignettes/gdsfmt.Rmd", so `vignette("gdsfmt")` can work directly

BUG FIXES

- avoid the segfault if the data type is not registered internally

- use O_CLOEXEC (the close-on-exec flag) when open and create files to
  avoid potentially leaking file descriptors in forked processes

[gemini](https://bioconductor.org/packages/gemini)
------

                        Changes in version 0.3.0                        

- 6-01-19: Introducing GEMINI, a variational Bayesian approach to
analyze pairwise CRISPR screens.

- Note: This is a pre-release version of GEMINI.

- Added a NEWS.md file to track changes to the package.

- Minor modifications were made to prepare for repository submission.

- 6-13-19: Incremented version number from 0.2.0 to 0.99.0 for
pre-release.

- 6-24-19: Bioconductor revision in progress. Version 0.99.9

- Note: This is a pre-release version of GEMINI.

- Modified documentation for all functions and added a workable
vignette

[geneClassifiers](https://bioconductor.org/packages/geneClassifiers)
---------------

                        Changes in version 1.9.0                        

- Bugfix: Added signature( "FixedExpressionData", i=ANY, j=missing )
  for the "[" and "[[" functions

- More indepth checking of function arguments

- Additional unit tests

[GENESIS](https://bioconductor.org/packages/GENESIS)
-------

                       Changes in version 2.15.3                        

- Add option "fastSKAT" to assocTestAggregate. Some other arguments and
  names of output columns for SKAT tests have also changed. This update
  includes code from the bigQF package
  (https://github.com/tslumley/bigQF). With the addition of C code,
  GENESIS now requires compliation.

[GenomicAlignments](https://bioconductor.org/packages/GenomicAlignments)
-----------------

                       Changes in version 1.22.0                        

NEW FEATURES

- Add stackStringsFromGAlignments(). Analog to stackStringsFromBam()
  except that it stacks the read sequences stored in a GAlignments
  object instead of a BAM file.

BUG FIXES

  'genome' is specified.

[GenomicFeatures](https://bioconductor.org/packages/GenomicFeatures)
---------------

                       Changes in version 1.38.0                        

NEW FEATURES

- Small improvement to exonicParts() and intronicParts(): - When
  'linked.to.single.gene.only' is set to TRUE, exonicParts() now
  returns an additional "exonic_part" metadata column that indicates
  the rank of each exonic part within all the exonic parts linked to
  the same gene. This is for compatibility with old disjointExons().  -
  intronicParts() does something similar except that the additional

[GenomicRanges](https://bioconductor.org/packages/GenomicRanges)
-------------

                       Changes in version 1.38.0                        

NEW FEATURES

- GPos objects now exist in 2 flavors: UnstitchedGPos and StitchedGPos
  GPos is now a virtual class with 2 concrete subclasses:
  UnstitchedGPos and StitchedGPos. In an UnstitchedGPos instance the
  positions are stored as an integer vector. In a StitchedGPos
  instance, like with old GPos instances, the positions are stored as
  an IRanges object where each range represents a run of consecutive
  positions. This is analog to the IPos/UnstitchedIPos/StitchedIPos
  situation. See ?GPos for more information. Old serialized GPos
  instances can be converted to StitchedGPos instances with
  updateObject().

- GPos objects now can hold names

- Coercion to GPos now propagates the names

- Add GRangesFactor class (Factor derivative). See ?GRangesFactor

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- Export from_GPos_to_GRanges()

- Some reorgnization of the GenomicRangesList hierarchy (see commit
  f988a5a9).

- Swap order of arguments 'seqlengths' and 'seqinfo' of the GRanges()
  constructor so now the latter comes before the former.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

- Remove findOverlaps, seqnames, and seqinfo<- methods for RangedData
  objects. These methods were deprecated in BioC 3.8 and defunct in
  BioC 3.9.

BUG FIXES

- Coercion from RangesList to GRanges is more robust to seqlevel
  differences

- Fix bug in isSmallGenome() (introduced by change in sum() in R >=
  3.5)

[GenomicScores](https://bioconductor.org/packages/GenomicScores)
-------------

                       Changes in version 1.10.0                        

USER VISIBLE CHANGES

- Added support to latest release 3.0 of gnomAD MAF data, stored in the
  package MafDb.gnomAD.r3.0.GRCh38.

- Individual allele frequencies can be now retrieved from MafDb.*
  packages when 'ref' and 'alt' arguments are given to the functions
  'gscores()' and 'score()'. See manual pages and vignette for further
  details.

- NonSNRs are now searched giving the argument type="equal" to
  findOverlaps(). This means that only scores from exact matches to
  nonSNRs are returned.

BUG FIXES

- Bugfix on the 'getGScores(') function that precluded accessing the
  files downloaded by the AnnotationHub

- Bugfix in accessing MAF values from nonSNVs when multiallelic
  variants are stored in different records from the VCF file.

[infercnv](https://bioconductor.org/packages/infercnv)
--------

                 Changes in version 1.1.4 (2019-10-29)                  

- Fix reading of input annotations when some are only digits to be
  properly read as characters.

- Added checks that HMM_report_by option is compatible with
  analysis_mode option. If not, change it automatically.

- Fix reading of bayesian filtered HMM results in add_to_seurat after
  previous version changes to keep CNV ids and states scale.

                 Changes in version 1.1.3 (2019-09-16)                  

- Fix to reload checks on HMM steps. +Added new smoothing method,
  'coordinates", that smooths the per cell data using a window based on
  a base pairs distance (around 10.000.000 seems to be a good start for
  the window size) to the current gene. As the hspike does not model
  gene distances/positions on a chromosome at this time, the HMM i6
  mode is not compatible with this smoothing method and an error will
  be returned if both try to be used together.

- Added a bp distance tolerance to "merge" top CNVs that are actually
  the same CNV in different subclusters in add_to_seurat method.

- Removed the top any type of CNV field, as it is redundant to top loss
  and top dupli.

- Added text output of identified top CNVs as they the base pair
  tolerance aggregates some compared to the original HMM output.

- Added an argument "up_to_step" to stop infercnv::run() after a given
  step.

- Fix contents of @options field in infercnv_obj to store non default
  run time arguments in the same form as object creation arguments.

- Update so that HMM predictions outputs have the analysis_mode in
  their name and do not get overwritten when using different modes. Can
  also know which pairs of file to reload together now.

- Update add_to_seurat so that it checks what analysis_mode was used in
  the run based on the @options field to reload the matching HMM
  predictions or Bayesian Network filtered predictions.

- Updated "subclustering" method for sample mode so that
  @tumor_subclusters$subclusters indices have the cell names attached
  to be able to map back in add_to_seurat.

- Allow HMM steps to be resumed if needed even if steps 20/21 are done.

                 Changes in version 1.1.2 (2019-07-08)                  

- Added method to write table of wide array of predicted features from
  HMM results to file or add them as meta.data to a Seurat object if
  one is provided.

- Overhaul of save/reload system to store non default arguments and
  keep track of relevant options at each step when trying to reload
  backups. Also check for input counts matrix identity with reloaded
  one (hash at object creation time).

- Added linking of image() option useRaster to run() and plot_cnv() to
  be able to enable by default, speeding up plotting significantly.

                 Changes in version 1.1.1 (2019-05-20)                  

- Added method to sample an infercnv object to a given number of cells,
  or at a given frequency, per annotation group. This is to make it
  easy to plot figures where all annotations groups have the same
  overall height, as well as downsample very large datasets that would
  otherwise take too long to plot (while still running the analysis on
  the full data)

- Added method to plot each annotation group to a different figure and
  combine with sampling. Mostly intended to split data for larger
  datasets.

- Added support for output_format option within run() to link to
  plot_cnv() to support only writting text outputs during the analysis.

                 Changes in version 1.0.4 (2019-09-16)                  

- Fix check that contig to cluster by was found when specified.

- Added support to plot_cnv for cell groups with exactly 2 cells.

- Fix which input file type is checked.

- Made it so that plot_cnv recalculates clustering automatically if non
  null ref_contig argument is provided.

- Fix for plot_cnv() when providing multiple ref_contigs and
  cluster_by_group is False.

- Fix only 1/n genes being taken into account when using n ref_contig
  in plot_cnv.

- Fix error in file creation when using multiple ref_contig and
  cluster_by_groups=FALSE in plot_cnv.

- Bayesian filtering now preserves CNV ids in outputs

                 Changes in version 1.0.3 (2019-07-05)                  

- Fix missing dendrograms in text output when drawing figures.

- Fix path to save object to when splitting references.

- Fix file name creation when using num_ref_groups option.

- Fix reference cells indices returned from method that splits
  references in num_ref_groups when references are not sorted and at
  the beginning of the matrix.

- Fix to support of data.frame as input type for counts matrix.

                 Changes in version 1.0.2 (2019-05-21)                  

- Reduce peak memory usage.

- Fix to subclusters definition when using a sparse matrix and a non
  random trees method with no references.

                 Changes in version 1.0.1 (2019-05-20)                  

- Improved when the clustering is defined for groups when running in
  sample mode.

- Fixed support for NA to be understood as an output_format value to
  plot_cnv() in case a user only wants to generate the text outputs and
  not the plot.

- Fix ordering of cells and color bars on the heatmap and text outputs
  when cells are not sorted in the same order in the input matrix and
  the annotation file.

- Fix to (sub)cluster definition when a group only has 1 cell.

- Fix plot_cnv() to handle observations groups with only 1 cell (that
  can't be hierarchically clustered), a single reference group when no
  references are not clusterd, and a single reference group with a
  single cell.

[InPAS](https://bioconductor.org/packages/InPAS)
-----

                       Changes in version 1.17.3

[IRanges](https://bioconductor.org/packages/IRanges)
-------

                       Changes in version 2.20.0                        

NEW FEATURES

- IPos objects now exist in 2 flavors: UnstitchedIPos and StitchedIPos
  IPos is now a virtual class with 2 concrete subclasses:
  UnstitchedIPos and StitchedIPos. In an UnstitchedIPos instance the
  positions are stored as an integer vector. In a StitchedIPos
  instance, like with old IPos instances, the positions are stored as
  an IRanges object where each range represents a run of consecutive
  positions. See ?IPos for more information.  Old serialized IPos
  instances need to be converted to StitchedIPos instances with
  updateObject().

- IPos objects now can hold names

- The IRanges() and IPos() constructors now accept user-supplied
  metadata columns

- Add grep(), startsWith() and endsWith() methods for CharacterList
  objects

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- as.data.frame(IRanges) now propagates the metadata columns

- Move splitAsList() to the S4Vector package

- Move S4 class "atomic" from the S4Vector package

- No longer export %in% (was a leftover from an older time when the
  package was defining an %in% method)

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

- After being deprecated in BioC 3.9, the following RangedData methods
  are now defunct: findOverlaps, rownames<-, colnames<-,
  columnMetadata, columnMetadata<-, c, rbind, as.env, as.data.frame,
  and coercion from RangedData to DataFrame.

- Remove the following RangedData methods: - score, score<-, lapply,
  within, countOverlaps; - coercions from list, data.frame, DataTable,
  Rle, RleList, RleViewsList, IntegerRanges, or IntegerRangesList to
  RangedData.  These methods were deprecated in BioC 3.8 and defunct in
  BioC 3.9.

BUG FIXES

- Fix integer overflow issue in end() setter for IRanges objects.

[IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR)
---------------------

                 Changes in version 1.7.2 (2019-10-18)                  

- Update type: Major.

- analyzeIUPred2A() for analyzing intrincially disordered regions (and
  binding sites therein) was introduced. To enable this the following
  changes were also made: * analyzeNetSurfP2() was extended to also
  create the idr_type column in the result *
  analyzeSwitchConsequences() was extended to handle idr_type. Also it
  was upgrated to handle large differences in IDR lengths. * The data
  included in the "exampleSwitchListAnalyzed" object was updated to
  include the result of an IUPred2A analysis (instead of the NetSurfP2
  analysis) * The build in data file for analysis of NetSurfP-2 in
  relation to exampleSwitchListIntermediary was replaced by the
  corresponding data for the IUPred2A analysis. *
  switchPlotTranscript() (which is used by switchPlot() internally) was
  extended to also handle IDR types * the switchPlot() layout was
  re-optimied for the new annotation. * isoformSwitchAnalysisPart2()
  was updated to also handle IUPred2A input. * The vignette was updated
  accordingly.

- switchPlotTranscript() (and thereby also switchPlot) now use the
  annotationImportance in a much nicer way. Instead of removing the
  annotation (which could cause problems when comparing computational
  analysis to visual output) it now uses annotationImportance to plot
  the data as layers with the most important on top - meaning no
  annotation is skipped.

- switchPlotGeneExp() was updated to follow the condition coloring used
  by switchPlotIsoExp() and switchPlotIsoUsage() when used by the
  switchPlot() function.

- Corrected a bug in switPlot() which caused the interpretation of the
  "increased/decreased usage" added to the plot to be the min instead
  of max of the supplied alphas.

- Corrected a bug in analyzeSwitchConsequences() that could cause the
  "domain_length" consequnce type to give wrong results. Now the
  'domain_length' test transcripts for differences in the length of
  overlapping domains of the same type (same hmm_name)

- isoformSwitchAnalysisPart2() now also uses n=Inf to create all plots
  (NA have same function for backward compatability).

- importRdata now ensures the order of columns in the designmatrix is
  always.

- All functions for importing external analysis, which supports
  multiple files, now automatically remove duplicated interies.

- The extractExpressionMatrix function was depreciated.

- All function documentation was spell-checked.

- Various documentation improvements.

- Error message improvements.

                 Changes in version 1.7.1 (2019-07-19)                  

- Update type: Minor.

- Version bump due to Bioconductor release.

- Updated NEWS layout in accordance with Bioconductor guidelines.

- switchPlotTranscript() was extended to also indicate
  increased/decreased/unchanged isoform usage making interpretation
  easier. This also required switchPlotTranscript() and switchPlot()
  was updated with extra arguments to control this behaviour. The
  switchPlotTranscript() function was furthermore updated to also
  indicate significance (indated by asterisks) and size (dIF) when used
  alone (aka not from within switchPlots) making it a good alternative
  to the switchPlot.

- switchPlotGeneExp(), switchPlotIsoExp(), switchPlotIsoUsage() was
  prettyfied and now also show the name of the gene plotted.

- importRdata() and importGTF() now also supports import of RefSeq GFF
  files (downloaded from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/, see FAQ
  in vignette). This should increase ease of usage for a long range of
  species not in the Ensembl catalogue.

- importRdata() * Now also removes non-exsisting introns from
  annotation even when it is supplied as a GRange (previously only done
  for GTF files). * No longer removes isoforms with NA as biotypes when
  removeTECgenes = TRUE. * Was extended to better handle gene_names
  when novelt transcripts are predicted. Specificallt if there are NA
  in the gene_name column (e.g. like done by StringTie) these are
  automatically assigned the same gene name as the other isoforms from
  the same gene_id (only for cases where a single gene_name is
  associated to the gene_id).

- isoformSwitchTestDEXSeq() was updated to: * Better handle rare design
  setups that could cause an error to occure. * Now handle analysis of
  data with some isoforms only analyzed in a subset of comparisons

- The extractSwitchSummary() was extended to also print number of
  switches.

- A bug was fixed in extractSequence() which cased a fail when CDS
  sequences with multiple stop codons where annotated

- A bug was fiexed which caused extractSplicingSummary() to only return
  the summary of splicing types with more than "minEventsForPlotting"
  events.

- analyzeNetSurfP2() was updated to handle multiple files due to recent
  restrictions on the number of sequences one can upload to the
  webserver.

- switchPlotTopSwitches() and extractTopSwitches() now uses n = Inf to
  to output all (although internally NA is converted to Inf for
  backward compatability).

- subsetSwitchAnalyzeRlist() was improved to be more stable to edgecase
  sitiuations.

- isoformToGeneExp() was improved * To be more userfriendly. * To
  directly support annotation stored in a GTF file (which it itself
  imports into R). * To directly support switchAnalyzeRlists.

- analyzePFAM() was updated to be more robust to edge usecases

- Improved error messages in mutliple function.

- Various documentation updates.

- Various stability updates.

  including windows and MAC_OS

[limma](https://bioconductor.org/packages/limma)
-----

                       Changes in version 3.42.0                        

- New head() and tail() methods for all limma data classes.

- New unique() and subsetting methods for TestResults objects.
  Previously a subsetted TestResults object became an ordinary numeric
  matrix, but now the TestResults class is preserved. Single index
  subsetting is also allowed but produces a numeric vector.

- roast() and mroast() now use less memory. Memory usage now remains
  bounded regardless of the number of rotations used. Both functions
  are faster than before when approx.zscore=TRUE. A new argument
  `legacy` is added to allow users to turn these improvements off if
  they wish to reproduce numerical results from limma 3.40.0 exactly.
  The default number of rotations `nrot` is increased from 999 to 1999.
  A bug has been fixed for roast() and mroast() when `index` is a
  character vector of geneids or rownames. Previously this usage
  failed.

- Complete rewrite of zscoreT(), which is now somewhat faster and offer
  two new options for the normalizing transformation. The new argument
  `method` indicates which transformation is used when `approx=TRUE`.
  The default approximation method is changed from "hill" to "bailey".
  zscoreT() now allows NA values when `approx=TRUE` and works correctly
  for all valid df values. Previously `approx=TRUE` returned NA results
  for `df` infinite or <= 0.05. A simple robust approximation from
  Wallace (1959) has been introduced to handle very large or very small
  `df` values. Previously `approx=FALSE` treated any `df` greater than
  10000 as infinite; this threshold is now raised to 1e300.

- tZScore() is slightly faster.

- New argument `gene.weights` for fry() so as to match the arguments
  and behavior of mroast(). Previously gene weights could be input to
  fry() only through the `index` argument. fry's mixed p-values now
  take account of gene weights. Previously gene weights were not used
  in fry's mixed p-value calculation.

- Add arguments `block`, `correlation` and `weights` to voom() and
  remove the `...` argument.

- Update the arguments of voomWithQualityWeights() to match the
  revisions to arrayWeights() in limma 3.40.0.  Add new argument
  `var.group`.

- New arguments `xlab`, `ylab` and `main` for plotFB(). The default
  plot title now includes the column name from the data object.
  Default for `pch` increased to 0.3.

- plotWithHighlights and plotMD.MArrayLM now gives special treatment to
  the case that `status` is a TestResults object.

- Update Yoruba case study in User's Guide to call voom() and
  duplicateCorrelation() twice each instead of once.

- Update Users Guide: update Rsubread reference, correct remarks about
  prior distribution for 1/sigma^2 in Section 13.2 and rerun the Yoruba
  and Pasilla case studies.

- Use "RNA-seq" and "ChIP-seq" consistently in the documentation
  instead of "RNA-Seq" and "ChIP-Seq".

- All uses of the approx() function now set
  `ties=list("ordered",mean)`, except for fitFDistRobustly() which uses
  `ties=mean`.  The change was prompted by a change in R 3.6.0 whereby
  using the default for `ties` generates a warning message whenever
  ties are present in `x`. The new code gives the same results but is
  very slightly faster and avoids the warning message.  limma now
  depends on R >= 3.6.0 because of this change.

- Fix bug in barcodeplot() when `index` or `index2` are character
  vectors.

NEW FUNCTIONS AND FEATURES

- `survGroup`, `mafSurvGroup` - Predict genes/genesets associated with
  survival. Issue: #396

- New argument `altered` in `oncoplot` to plot top genes based on CNV
  or mutation. Default is `FALSE`. Issue: #405

  correlation metric from `estimateSignatures` and helps to decide an
  optimal number of signature `(n)`.

[PureCN](https://bioconductor.org/packages/PureCN)
------

                       Changes in version 1.16.0                        

NEW FEATURES

- Flag segments in poor quality regions

- predictSomatic now provides log-likelihood of allelic balance
  (ALLELIC.IMBALANCE column) for each variant

- Added readLogRatioFile function to read GATK4 DenoiseReadCounts
  output files containing log2 tumor/normal ratios

- Added readSegmentationFile function to read GATK4 ModelSegment output
  files containing segmented log2 tumor/normal ratios

- Added callAmplificationsInLowPurity to call gene-level amplifications
  in samples < 10% purity

- Dx.R now reports chromosomal instability scores (available also via
  callCIN function)

- Dx.R supports deconstructSigs 1.9.0 and COSMIC signatures v3. To run
  both v2 and v3, simply add --signature_databases
  signatures.exome.cosmic.v3.may2019:signatures.cosmic to Dx.R

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- Made filterTargets and createTargetWeights defunct

- setMappingBiasVcf now returns a data.frame

- Best practices vignette now HTML-based

- Renamed normal.panel.vcf.file in setMappingBiasVcf to
  mapping.bias.file; in 1.18, setMappingBiasVcf will not accept a VCF
  anymore but requires a precomputed mapping bias RDS file.

- calculateIntervalWeights now directly called by createNormalDatabase
  and information included in the normalDB RDS object. This function is
  thus deprecated.

- Column gene.mean in callAlterations output now weighted by interval
  weights when available

- Changed default of min.target.width in preprocessIntervals from 10 to
  100 (#73)

- replaced write.table with data.table::fwrite to automatically support
  producing gzipped output (requires data.table 1.12.4, #106)

- Coverage.R now gzips BAM file coverage (requires data.table 1.12.4,
  #106)

- Output coverage files now code FALSE as 0 and TRUE as 1

- PureCN.R now bgzips and tabix indexes VCFs when --vcf is provided

BUGFIXES

- Fix for bug in CCF calculation resulting in NAs (happens in high
  coverage samples, early mutations with > 1 allele copy number)

- Fix for a bug in preprocessIntervals when small targets (<
  min.target.width) were present

- Fix for a bug in callMutationBurden when VCF contained indels (#82)

- Die with helpful error message when snp.blacklist import failed

- Check input segmentation files for missing values resulting in crash

- Fixed a crash in Varscan2 produced VCFs when ALT field missed ref
  counts (#109)

[pwrEWAS](https://bioconductor.org/packages/pwrEWAS)
-------

                        Changes in version 0.1.0                        

- Initial version

[QDNAseq](https://bioconductor.org/packages/QDNAseq)
-------

                 Changes in version 1.21.6 (2019-09-25)                 

BUG FIXES

- Link to the 'GEM library' tool was broken.

                 Changes in version 1.21.5 (2019-09-09)                 

BUG FIXES

- plot(..., logTransform=TRUE, doSegments=TRUE) on QDNAseqSignals would
  position segments that were out of range incorrectly, because it
  forgot to take the log transform on those outliers.

                 Changes in version 1.21.4 (2019-09-06)                 

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

- Bin annotation data files are no longer downloaded automatically.
  They are instead part of Bioconductor annotation packages
  QDNAseq.hg19 and QDNAseq.mm10, which needs to be installed by the
  user.  If not installed, an error is now produced.  The reason for
  this change, is that the QDNAseq maintainers will no longer host
  QDNAseq bin annotation files online (in the cloud).

                 Changes in version 1.21.3 (2019-09-04)                 

NEW FEATURES

- All functions that produce verbose output gained argument 'verbose'.
  For backward compatibility, it currently defaults to 'verbose=TRUE'
  but that may be changed to 'verbose=FALSE' in a future release.

IMPROVEMENTS

- callBins() now respects option 'QDNAseq::verbose' for controlling
  whether output from the CGHcall package should be relayed or not.

- MEMORY: Utilize more memory-efficient matrixStats functions
  colSums2(), colMeans2(), etc.

DEPRECATION AND DEFUNCT

- Argument 'seeds' of segmentBins() is deprecated because it did not
  use proper parallel random number generation (RNG).  We now instead
  rely on future.apply::future_lapply(..., future.seed=TRUE) for this.

                 Changes in version 1.21.2 (2019-09-03)                 

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

- Package now imports the 'future' and 'future.apply' packages;
  previously the 'future' was listed as a suggested package.

- Package no longer depends on BiocParallel.

- binReadCounts() now uses the future framework instead of BiocParallel
  for parallelization.

IMPROVEMENTS

- MEMORY: Avoiding data type coercions in more places by for instance
  making sure that vectors and matrices are initated with the values of
  the correct data type (instead of the default NA, which is a logical
  value).

SOFTWARE QUALITY

- Using future_lapply() and future_apply() of the well-tested
  future.apply package instead of internal analogue implementations.

- TESTS: Now testing numerical reproducibility also for parallel
  processing (using future strategies 'multisession' and 'multicore').

- TESTS: Now asserting numerical reproducibility of also segmentBins()
  and callBins().

                 Changes in version 1.21.1 (2019-08-30)                 

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

- exportVCF() is no longer exported. Use exportBins(..., format="vcf")
  instead.

------------

                       Changes in version 1.42.0                        

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- As announced in version 1.40.0, the graphical user interface is gone
  for good (i.e., defunct). The source code is available in my github
  repository.

NEW FEATURES

- The most interesting feature is the introduction of a custom CDF-4
  format which hold the same data as a normal CDF-3 (as exported by the
  software vendors), but allows faster read-access (specially for
  plotting) and compression (among other features). This is at the cost
  of compatibility as the CDF-4 files are unlikely to be used outsied
  TargetSearch

- A new baseline correction method based on quantiles around a
  retention time window. In addition, the new CDF-4 file format allows
  storing of baseline-corrected values so it is not needed to recompute
  the baseline each time like in older TargetSearch versions.

- New function to transform to nominal mass. Some GC instruments export
  CDF not in nominal mass format (some even export high mass accuracy).
  Formely, this type of files were not supported and TargetSearch would
  refuse to process them. Now, all types of mass accuracy are allowed,
  obviously at the cost of losing that accuracy.

BUG FIXES

- Mostly code refactoring and house-keeping.

[tRNAscanImport](https://bioconductor.org/packages/tRNAscanImport)
--------------

                 Changes in version 1.5.3 (2019-08-25)                  

- added get.tRNAprecursor function to retrieve tRNA precursor sequences
  in combination with genomic sequences

- fixed typos in the NEWS file

- updated tRNAscan example file for human (the high confidence set is
  now included)

[TSRchitect](https://bioconductor.org/packages/TSRchitect)
----------

                       Changes in version 1.11.12                       

- Updates to include 3'-read capturing from bam input files and data
  structures to allow ignoring spurious TSSs.

- Added capabilities for sorting by strand (and seq/TSS) for TSS
  merging.

- Made a change leading to a substantial speed-up of mergeSampleData().

- Added qname to saved columns from .bam input.

- Minor changes to writeTSR() and writeTSS().

- Rewrite to mergeSampleData).

- Improvements to loadTSSobj().

[tximeta](https://bioconductor.org/packages/tximeta)
-------

                        Changes in version 1.4.0                        

- tximeta will now pull down RefSeq seqinfo, using the dirname() of the
  GTF location, and assuming some consistency in the structure of the
  assembly_report.txt that is located in the same directory. Needs more
  testing though across releases and organisms.

- expanded caching of ranges to exons and genes as well. Exons in
  particular take a long time to build from TxDb, so this saves quite a
  lot of time.

- new 'addExons' function will add exons to trancript-level summarized
  experiments, by replacing transcript GRanges with exon-by-transcript
  GRangesList. Purposely designed only for transcript-level, see note
  in ?addExons

- tximeta now also caches the transcript ranges themselves, rather than
  just the TxDb. This shaves extra seconds off the tximeta() call!

- add 'skipSeqinfo' argument, which avoids attempting to fetch
  chromosome information (from UCSC) if set to TRUE.

[tximport](https://bioconductor.org/packages/tximport)
--------

                       Changes in version 1.14.0

  import the inferential replicates, set dropInfReps=TRUE.

[Ularcirc](https://bioconductor.org/packages/Ularcirc)
--------

[universalmotif](https://bioconductor.org/packages/universalmotif)
--------------

                        Changes in version 1.4.0                        

NEW FEATURES

- scan_sequences(..., threshold.type) option: 'logodds.abs'. Allows the
  exact threshold scores to be provided.

- compare_motifs() option: 'min.position.ic'. Prevent low-IC positions
  in an alignment from contributing to the final alignment score.

- compare_motifs() option: 'score.strat'. Instruct the function how to
  deal with individual column scores in an alignment. This is also
  replaced the old way of choosing between sum and mean via prepending
  an 'M' to the metric name. Strategies for combining column scores
  include: sum, arithmetic mean, geometric mean, median, Fisher
  Z-transform, and weighted means.

- Motif comparison metrics: average log-likelihood ratio, squared
  Euclidean distance, Hellinger distance, Bhattacharyya coefficient,
  Manhattan distance, lower limit average log-likelihood ratio,
  weighted Euclidean distance, weighted Pearson correlation
  coefficient.

- compare_columns() utility: Compare two 1d numeric vectors using the
  comparison metrics from compare_motifs().

- compare_motifs() option: 'output.report'. Generate an output report
  when 'compare.to' is provided, showing motif alignments of top
  matches.

- get_scores() utility: Extract all possible scores from a motif.

- filter_motifs(): Filter using the 'extrainfo' slot.

- MotifComparisonAndPvalues.pdf vignette: the comparisons and P-values
  sections have been moved from AdvancedUsage.pdf to their own
  vignette. Higher order motifs, enrichment and run_meme() usage
  sections have been moved to SequenceSearches.pdf.

MINOR CHANGES

- Removed 'random' shuffling method.

- Using RcppThread instead of BiocParallel in several functions:
  compare_motifs(), create_sequences(), get_bkg(), motif_pvalue(),
  scan_sequences(), shuffle_sequences(). This means parallelization can
  occur within C++ code which is much faster than having to jump
  between R and C++. Currently motif_peaks(), read_motifs() and
  write_motifs() are the only remaining functions which offer optional
  BiocParallel usage.

- Many performance improvements to functions relying on internal C++
  code. Several internal R functions have been replaced with C++
  versions.

- Changed behaviour of make_DBscores() and motif comparison P-values.
  Re-calculated internal P-value databases.

- For merge_motifs(..., use.type): now only accepts 'PPM'.

- When comparing all motifs to all motifs with any method in
  compare_motifs(), the diagonal entries now properly show the max/min
  possible similarity/distance scores.

- New internal merge_motifs() implementation. This also fixes a
  previous bug with incorrect PPM averaging.

- read_homer(): the logodds score is converted to a P-value.

- motif_pvalue(): New score calculator. Exact scores are still
  calculated the same (but with a faster C++ function), but approximate
  scores are now calculated by randomly generating score distributions
  from size 'k' motif score blocks.

- motif_pvalue(): Added a safety check when trying to use this function
  with large motifs. Will throw a warning when nrow(matrix)^k > 1e8 and
  reduce k accordingly before continuing.

- Adjusted P-value calculation in motif_peaks() to not display Pval = 0
  so easily by instead estimating a normal distribution from random
  peaks.

- convert_type(): make sure not to leave any zeros in bkg vector when a
  pseudocount greater than zero is used.

- enrich_motifs(): split up 'hits' and 'positional' resuts into their
  own data.frames.

- Replaced several instances of cat() with message() for printing
  progress updates.

- Positional tests have been removed from enrich_motifs(). See
  motif_peaks() for testing motif-sequence positional preferences.

- In read_meme(): E-values are now additionally stored in the extrainfo
  slot. This is to preserve E-values smaller than the R double
  precision limit.

- In read_transfac(): Matrix values are rounded, to prevent errors when
  reading in matrices with non-integers.

- Update JASPAR2018_CORE_DBSCORES with new compare_motifs() methods and
  params.

- universalmotif print() method now returns the object invisibly,
  instead of NULL.

BUG FIXES

- read_meme() will now properly parse background letter frequencies
  which span more than one line.

- convert_motifs() will not error-out when trying to convert a PFMatrix
  with a family character vector longer than one.

- Fixed P-value calculation when importing HOMER motifs. Peviously it
  would simply assume the log threshold value was the P-value. Now
  motif_pvalue() is used to properly calculate a P-value.

                        Changes in version 1.2.1                        

BUG FIXES

- Mispelled variable in enrich_motifs()
