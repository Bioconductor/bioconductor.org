hierarchical model. The algorithm returns the posterior
probability of differential expression for each gene between two
groups A and B. The joint posterior distribution of the variables
in the model can be returned in the form of posterior samples,
which can be used for further down-stream analyses such as gene
set enrichment.


BAGS: R package providing functions to perform geneset significance
analysis over simple cross-sectional data between 2 and 5
phenotypes of interest.


BiGGR: This package provides an interface to simulate metabolic
reconstruction from the BiGG database(http://bigg.ucsd.edu/) and
other metabolic reconstruction databases. The package aids in
performing flux balance analysis (FBA). Metabolic networks and
estimated fluxes can be visualized using hypergraphs.


bioassayR: bioassayR provides tools for statistical analysis of small
molecule bioactivity data


BiocParallel: This package provides modified versions and novel
implementation of functions for parallel evaluation, tailored to
use with Bioconductor objects.


BiocStyle: Provides standard formatting styles for Bioconductor
documents. The vignette illustrates use and functionality.


BiRewire: Fast functions for bipartite network rewiring through N
consecutive switching steps (See References) and for the
computation of the minimal number of switching steps to be
performed in order to maximise the dissimilarity with respect to
the original network. Includes function for the analysis of the
introduced randomness across the switching and several other
routines to analyse the resulting networks and their natural
projections. Extension to undirected networks (not bipartite) is
also provided.


CexoR: Strand specific peak-pair calling in ChIP-exo replicates. The
cumulative Skellam distribution function (package 'skellam') is
used to detect significant normalized count differences of
opposed sign at each DNA strand (peak-pairs). Irreproducible
discovery rate for overlapping peak-pairs across biological
replicates is estimated using the package 'idr'.


ChAMP: The package includes quality control metrics, a selection of
normalization methods and novel methods to identify
differentially methylated regions and to highlight copy number
aberrations.


ChemmineOB: ChemmineOB provides an R interface to a subset of
cheminformatics functionalities implemented by the OpelBabel C++
project. OpenBabel is an open source cheminformatics toolbox that
includes utilities for structure format interconversions,
descriptor calculations, compound similarity searching and mor.
ChemineOB aims to make a subset of these utilities available from
within R. For non-developers, ChemineOB is primarily intended to
be used from ChemmineR as an add-on package rather than used
directly.


chipenrich: ChIP-Enrich performs gene set enrichment testing using
peaks called from a ChIP-seq experiment. The method empirically
corrects for confounding factors such as the length of genes, and
the mappability of the sequence surrounding genes.


cleanUpdTSeq: This package uses the Naive Bayes classifier (from
e1071) to assign probability values to putative polyadenylation
sites (pA sites) based on training data from zebrafish. This will
allow the user to separate true, biologically relevant pA sites
from false, oligodT primed pA sites.


cleaver: In-silico cleavage of polypeptide sequences. The cleavage
rules are taken from:
http://web.expasy.org/peptide_cutter/peptidecutter_enzymes.html


clonotypeR: High throughput analysis of T cell antigen receptor
sequences The genes encoding T cell receptors are created by
somatic recombination, generating an immense combination of V,
(D) and J segments.  Additional processes during the
recombination create extra sequence diversity between the V an J
segments.  Collectively, this hyper-variable region is called the
CDR3 loop.

The purpose of this package is to process and quantitatively analyse
millions of V-CDR3-J combination, called clonotypes, from
multiple sequence libraries.

CNVrd2: CNVrd2 uses next-generation sequencing data to measure human
gene copy number for multiple samples, identify SNPs tagging copy number
variants and detect copy number polymorphic genomic regions.

cobindR: Finding and analysing co-occuring motifs of transcription
factor binding sites in groups of genes


CSSP: Power computation for ChIP-Seq data based on Bayesian
estimation for local poisson counting process.


customProDB: Generate customized protein sequence database from
RNA-Seq data for proteomics search


dagLogo: Visualize significant conserved amino acid sequence pattern
in groups based on probability theory


DNaseR: Strand-specific digital genomic footprinting in DNase-seq
data. The cumulative Skellam distribution function (package
'skellam') is used to detect significant normalized count
differences of opposed sign at each DNA strand. This is done in
order to determine the protein-binding footprint flanks.
Preprocessing of the mapped reads is recommended before running
DNaseR (e.g., quality checking and removal of sequence-specific
bias).


EBSeq: Differential Expression analysis at both gene and isoform
level using RNA-seq data


epivizr: This package provides Websocket communication to the epiviz
web app (http://epiviz.cbcb.umd.edu) for interactive
visualization of genomic data. Objects in R/bioc interactive
sessions can be displayed in genome browser tracks or plots to be
explored by navigation through genomic regions. Fundamental
Bioconductor data structures are supported (e.g., GenomicRanges
and SummarizedExperiment objects), while providing an easy
mechanism to support other data structures. Visualizations (using
d3.js) can be easily added to the web app as well.


exomePeak: The package is developed for the analysis of
affinity-based epitranscriptome shortgun sequencing data from
MeRIP-seq (maA-seq). It was built on the basis of the exomePeak
MATLAB package (Meng, Jia, et al. "Exome-based analysis for RNA
epigenome sequencing data." Bioinformatics 29.12 (2013):
1565-1567.) with new functions for differential analysis of two
experimental conditions to unveil the dynamics in
post-transcriptional regulation of the RNA methylome. The
exomePeak R-package accepts and statistically supports multiple
biological replicates, internally removes PCR artifacts and
multi-mapping reads, outputs exome-based binding sites (RNA
methylation sites) and detects differential post-transcriptional
RNA modification sites between two experimental conditions in
term of percentage rather the absolute amount. The package is
still under active development, and we welcome all biology and
computation scientist for all kinds of collaborations and
communications. Please feel free to contact Dr. Jia Meng
<jia.meng@hotmail.com> if you have any questions.


FGNet: Build and visualize functional gene networks from clustering
of enrichment analyses in multiple annotation spaces. The package
includes an interface to perform the analysis through David and
GeneTerm Linker.


flipflop: Flipflop discovers which isoforms of a gene are expressed
in a given sample together with their abundances, based on
RNA-Seq read data.


flowBeads: This package extends flowCore to provide functionality
specific to bead data. One of the goals of this package is to
automate analysis of bead data for the purpose of normalisation.


flowFit: This package estimate the proliferation of a cell population
in cell-tracking dye studies. The package uses an R
implementation of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (minpack.lm)
to fit a set of peaks (corresponding to different generations of
cells) over the proliferation-tracking dye distribution in a FACS
experiment.


flowMap: This package provides an algorithm to compare and match cell
populations across multiple flow cytometry samples. The method is
based on the Friedman-Rafsky test, a nonparametric multivariate
statistical test, where two cell distributions match if they
occupy a similar feature space. The algorithm allows the users to
specify a reference sample for comparison or to construct a
reference sample from the available data. The output of the
algorithm is a set of text files where the cell population labels
are replaced by a metaset of population labels, generated from
the matching process.


GOSim: This package implements several functions useful for computing
similarities between GO terms and gene products based on their GO
annotation. Moreover it allows for computing a GO enrichment
analysis


h5vc: This package contains functions to interact with tally data
from NGS experiments that is stored in HDF5 files. For detail see
the webpage at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~pyl/h5vc.

counts, to discover differentially expressed proteins between two
biological conditions. Three tests are available: Poisson GLM
regression, quasi-likelihood GLM regression, and the negative
binomial of the edgeR package.The three models admit blocking
factors to control for nuissance variables.To assure a good level
of reproducibility a post-test filter is available, where we may
set the minimum effect size considered biologicaly relevant, and
the minimum expression of the most abundant condition.


MSstats: A set of tools for protein significance analysis in
label-free or LC-MS, SRM and DIA experiments.


mzID: A parser for mzIdentML files implemented using the XML package.
The parser tries to be general and able to handle all types of
mzIdentML files with the drawback of having less 'pretty' output
than a vendor specific parser. Please contact the maintainer with
any problems and supply an mzIdentML file so the problems can be
fixed quick.


neaGUI: neaGUI is an easy to use R package developed to perform the
network enrichment analysis (NEA) proposed by Alexeyenko et al.
(2012). The NEA method extends the overlap statistics in GSEA to
network links between genes in the experimental set and those in
the functional categories by exploiting biological information in
terms of gene interaction network. The neaGUI requires the
following R packages: tcltk, KEGG.db, GO.db, reactome.db,
org.Hs.eg.db, AnnotationDbi, and hwriter.


NetSAM: The NetSAM (Network Seriation and Modularization) package
takes an edge-list representation of a network as an input,
performs network seriation and modularization analysis, and
generates as files that can be used as an input for the
one-dimensional network visualization tool NetGestalt
(http://www.netgestalt.org) or other network analysis.

methods in sequential way to mimic the manual gating strategy.


paircompviz: This package provides visualization of the results from
the multiple (i.e. pairwise) comparison tests such as
pairwise.t.test, pairwise.prop.test or pairwise.wilcox.test. The
groups being compared are visualized as nodes in Hasse diagram.
Such approach enables very clear and vivid depiction of which
group is significantly greater than which others, especially if
comparing a large number of groups.


pathifier: Pathifier is an algorithm that infers pathway deregulation
scores for each tumor sample on the basis of expression data.
This score is determined, in a context-specific manner, for every
particular dataset and type of cancer that is being investigated.
The algorithm transforms gene-level information into
pathway-level information, generating a compact and biologically
relevant representation of each sample.


plethy: This package provides the infrastructure and tools to import,
query and perform basic analysis of whole body plethysmography
and metabolism data.  Currently support is limited to data
derived from Buxco respirometry instruments as exported by their
FinePointe software.


ProCoNA: Protein co-expression network construction using peptide
level data, with statisical analysis. (Journal of Clinical
Bioinformatics 2013, 3:11 doi:10.1186/2043-9113-3-11)


prot2D: The purpose of this package is to analyze (i.e. Normalize and
select significant spots) data issued from 2D GEl experiments


PSICQUIC: PSICQUIC is a project within the HUPO Proteomics Standard
Initiative (HUPO-PSI).  It standardises programmatic access to
molecular interaction databases.


qcmetrics: The package provides a framework for generic quality
control of data. It permits to create, manage and visualise
individual or sets of quality control metrics and generate
quality control reports in various formats.


qusage: This package is an implementation the Quantitative Set
Analysis for Gene Expression (QuSAGE) method described in (Yaari
G. et al, Nucl Acids Res, 2013). This is a novel Gene Set
Enrichment-type test, which is designed to provide a faster, more
accurate, and easier to understand test for gene expression
studies. qusage accounts for inter-gene correlations using the
Variance Inflation Factor technique proposed by Wu et al.
(Nucleic Acids Res, 2012). In addition, rather than simply
evaluating the deviation from a null hypothesis with a single
number (a P value), qusage quantifies gene set activity with a
complete probability density function (PDF). From this PDF, P
values and confidence intervals can be easily extracted.
Preserving the PDF also allows for post-hoc analysis (e.g.,
pair-wise comparisons of gene set activity) while maintaining
statistical traceability. Finally, while qusage is compatible
with individual gene statistics from existing methods (e.g.,
LIMMA), a Welch-based method is implemented that is shown to
improve specificity. For questions, contact Chris Bolen
(cbolen1@gmail.com) or Steven Kleinstein
(steven.kleinstein@yale.edu)


Rchemcpp: The Rchemcpp package implements the marginalized graph
kernel and extensions, Tanimoto kernels, graph kernels,
pharmacophore and 3D kernels suggested for measuring the
similarity of molecules.


RDAVIDWebService: Tools for retrieving data from the Database for
Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) using
Web Services into R objects. This package offers the main
functionalities of DAVID website including: i) user friendly
connectivity to upload gene/background list/s, change
gene/background position, select current specie/s, select
annotations, etc. ii) Reports of the submitted Gene List,
Annotation Category Summary, Gene/Term Clusters, Functional
Annotation Chart, Functional Annotation Table


rfPred: Based on external numerous data files where rfPred scores are
pre-calculated on all genomic positions of the human exome, the
package gives rfPred scores to missense variants identified by
the chromosome, the position (hg19 version), the referent and
alternative nucleotids and the uniprot identifier of the protein.
Note that for using the package, the user has to be connected on
the Internet or to download the TabixFile and index
(approximately 3.3 Go).


Roleswitch: Infer Probabilities of MiRNA-mRNA Interaction Signature
(ProMISe) using paired expression data from a single sample.
Roleswitch operates in two phases by inferring the probability of
mRNA (miRNA) being the targets ("targets") of miRNA (mRNA),
taking into account the expression of all of the mRNAs (miRNAs)
due to their potential competition for the same miRNA (mRNA). Due
to dynamic miRNA repression in the cell, Roleswitch assumes that
the total transcribed mRNA levels are higher than the observed
(equilibrium) mRNA levels and iteratively updates the total
transcription of each mRNA targets based on the above inference.


RRHO: The package is aimed at inference on the amount of agreement in
two sorted lists using the Rank-Rank Hypergeometric Overlap test.


RTN: This package provides classes and methods for transcriptional
network inference and analysis. Modulators of transcription
factor activity are assessed by conditional mutual information,
and master regulators are mapped to phenotypes using different
strategies, e.g., gene set enrichment, shadow and synergy
analyses.


rTRM: rTRM identifies transcriptional regulatory modules (TRMs) from
protein-protein interaction networks.


rTRMui: This package provides a web interface to compute
transcriptional regulatory modules with rTRM.


seqCNA: Copy number analysis of high-throughput sequencing cancer
data with fast summarization, extensive filtering and improved
normalization


SeqVarTools: An interface to the fast-access storage format for VCF
data provided in SeqArray, with tools for common operations and
analysis.


shinyTANDEM: This package provides a GUI interface for rTANDEM. The
GUI is primarily designed to visualize rTANDEM result object or
result xml files. But it also provides an interface for creating
parameter objects, launching searches or performing conversions
between R objects and xml files.


SigFuge: Algorithm for testing significance of clustering in RNA-seq
data.


SimBindProfiles: SimBindProfiles identifies common and unique binding
regions in genome tiling array data. This package does not rely
on peak calling, but directly compares binding profiles processed
on the same array platform. It implements a simple threshold
approach, thus allowing retrieval of commonly and differentially
bound regions between datasets as well as events of compensation
and increased binding.


SpacePAC: Identifies clustering of somatic mutations in proteins via
a simulation approach while considering the protein's tertiary
structure.


spliceR: An R package for classification of alternative splicing and
prediction of coding potential from RNA-seq data.


spliceSites: Align gap positions from RNA-seq data


sRAP: This package provides a pipeline for gene expression analysis
(primarily for RNA-Seq data).  The normalization function is
specific for RNA-Seq analysis, but all other functions (Quality
Control Figures, Differential Expression and Visualization, and
Functional Enrichment via BD-Func) will work with any type of
gene expression data.


sSeq: The purpose of this package is to discover the genes that are
differentially expressed between two conditions in RNA-seq
experiments. Gene expression is measured in counts of transcripts
and modeled with the Negative Binomial (NB) distribution using a
shrinkage approach for dispersion estimation. The method of
moment (MM) estimates for dispersion are shrunk towards an
estimated target, which minimizes the average squared difference
between the shrinkage estimates and the initial estimates. The
exact per-gene probability under the NB model is calculated, and
used to test the hypothesis that the expected expression of a
gene in two conditions identically follow a NB distribution.


STRINGdb: The STRINGdb package provides a user-friendly interface to
the STRING protein-protein interactions database (
http://www.string-db.org ).


supraHex: A supra-hexagonal map is a giant hexagon on a 2-dimensional
grid seamlessly consisting of smaller hexagons. It is supposed to
train, analyse and visualise a high-dimensional omics data. The
supraHex is able to carray out gene/meta-gene clustering and
sample correlation, plus intuitive visualisations to facilitate
exploratory analysis. Uniquely to this package, users can
simultaneously understand their own omics data in a
sample-specific fashion but without loss of information on large
genes.


SwimR: SwimR is an R-based suite that calculates, analyses, and plots
the frequency of C. elegans swimming behavior over time.  It
places a particular emphasis on identifying paralysis and
quantifying the kinetic elements of paralysis during swimming.
Data is input to SwipR from a custom built program that fits a 5
point morphometric spine to videos of single worms swimming in a
buffer called Worm Tracker.


TargetScore: Infer the posterior distributions of microRNA targets by
probabilistically modelling the likelihood
microRNA-overexpression fold-changes and sequence-based scores.
Variaitonal Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (VB-GMM) is applied
to log fold-changes and sequence scores to obtain the posteriors
of latent variable being the miRNA targets. The final targetScore
is computed as the sigmoid-transformed fold-change weighted by
the averaged posteriors of target components over all of the
features.


TCC: This package provides a series of functions for performing
differential expression analysis from RNA-seq count data using
robust normalization strategy (called DEGES). The basic idea of
DEGES is that potential differentially expressed genes or
transcripts (DEGs) among compared samples should be removed
before data normalization to obtain a well-ranked gene list where
true DEGs are top-ranked and non-DEGs are bottom ranked. This can
be done by performing a multi-step normalization strategy (called
DEGES for DEG elimination strategy). A major characteristic of
TCC is to provide the robust normalization methods for several
kinds of count data (two-group with or without replicates,
multi-group/multi-factor, and so on) by virtue of the use of
combinations of functions in other sophisticated packages
(especially edgeR, DESeq, and baySeq).


TFBSTools: Software package for TFBS.


tRanslatome: Detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from
the comparison of two biological conditions (treated vs.
untreated, diseased vs. normal, mutant vs. wild-type) among
different levels of gene expression (transcriptome ,translatome,
proteome), using several statistical methods: Rank Product,
t-test, SAM, Limma, ANOTA, DESeq, edgeR. Possibility to plot the
results with scatterplots, histograms, MA plots, standard
deviation (SD) plots, coefficient of variation (CV) plots.
Detection of significantly enriched post-transcriptional
regulatory factors (RBPs, miRNAs, etc) and Gene Ontology terms in
the lists of DEGs previously identified for the two expression
levels. Comparison of GO terms enriched only in one of the levels
or in both. Calculation of the semantic similarity score between
the lists of enriched GO terms coming from the two expression
levels. Visual examination and comparison of the enriched terms
with heatmaps, radar plots and barplots.


trio: Testing SNPs and SNP interactions with a genotypic TDT. This
package furthermore contains functions for computing pairwise
values of LD measures and for identifying LD blocks, as well as
functions for setting up matched case pseudo-control genotype
data for case-parent trios in order to run trio logic regression,
for imputing missing genotypes in trios, for simulating
case-parent trios with disease risk dependent on SNP interaction,
and for power and sample size calculation in trio data.


vtpnet: variant-transcription factor-phenotype networks, inspired by
Maurano et al., Science (2012), PMID 22955828


XVector: Memory efficient S4 classes for storing sequences
"externally" (behind an R external pointer, or on disk).

affxparser
----------

Changes in version 1.34.0 (2012-10-14):

- The version number was bumped for the Bioconductor release version,
  which is now Bioc v2.13 for R (>= 3.0.0).

Changes in version 1.33.4 (2013-09-23):

- SPEEDUP/CLEANUP: Package now uses which() instead of whichVector() of
  'R.utils'.  Before R (< 2.11.0), which() used to be 10x slower than
  whichVector(), but now it's 3x faster.

Changes in version 1.33.3 (2013-06-29):

- Same updates as in release v1.32.3.

Changes in version 1.33.2 (2013-05-25):

- Same updates as in release v1.32.2.

Changes in version 1.33.1 (2013-05-20):

- Same updates as in release v1.32.1.

Changes in version 1.33.0 (2013-04-03):

- The version number was bumped for the Bioconductor devel version.

- No updates.

Changes in version 1.32.3 (2013-06-29):

- BUG FIX: Since affxparser v1.30.2/1.31.2 (r72352; 2013-01-08),
  writeCdf() would incorrectly encode the unit types, iff the input
  'cdf' argument specified them as integers, e.g. as done by writeCdf()
  for AffyGenePDInfo in aroma.affymetrix.  More specifically, the unit
  type index would be off by one, e.g. an 'expression' unit (1) would
  be encoded as an 'unknown' unit (0) and so on.  On the other hand, if
  they were specified by their unit-type names (e.g. 'expression') the
  encoding should still be correct, e.g. if input is constructed from
  readCdf() of affxparser. Thanks to Guido Hooiveld at Wageningen UR
  (The Netherlands) for reporting on this.

- BUG FIX: Similarily, writeCdf() has "always", at least affxparser
  v1.7.4 since (r21888; 2007-01-09), encoded unit directions and QC
  unit types incorrectly, iff they were specified as integers.

Changes in version 1.32.2 (2013-05-25):

- SPEEDUP: Removed all remaining gc() calls.

- SPEEDUP: Replaced all rm() calls with NULL assignments.

Changes in version 1.32.1 (2013-05-20):

Changes in version 1.31.7 (2013-09-27):

- SPEEDUP: Now all package functions utilizes 'matrixStats' functions
  where possible, e.g. anyMissing(), colMins(), and
  rowWeightedMedians().

- Bumped up package dependencies.

Changes in version 1.31.6 (2013-09-25):

- CLEANUP: Package no longer use a fallback attachment of the 'R.oo'
  package upon attachment.

Changes in version 1.31.5 (2013-09-23):

- ROBUSTNESS: Now properly declaring all S3 methods in the NAMESPACE
  file.

  10x slower than whichVector(), but now it's 3x faster.

- CLEANUP: Now only using 'Authors@R' in DESCRIPTION, which is possible
  since R (>= 2.14.0).  Hence the new requirement on the version of R.

  also removes one dependency on 'R.utils'.

Changes in version 1.30.4 (2013-09-25):

- Backport from v1.31.4: Now package explicitly imports what it needs
  from matrixStats.

Changes in version 1.30.2 (2013-05-20):

- CRAN POLICY: Now all Rd \usage{} lines are at most 90 characters
  long.

Changes in version 1.30.1 (2013-04-18):

- Now backtransformPrincipalCurve() preserves dimension names.

- BUG FIX: backtransformPrincipalCurve() gave an error if the pricipal
  curve was fitted using data with missing values.

CNORfuzzy
---------

Changes in version 1.4.0:

- cSimulator handles non integers values for the ihibitors and stimuli

- gaDiscreteT1.R: fix issue when only 1 model was returned within
  tolerance

- reduceFuzzy.R fix bug that causes seg faut (model was not cut
  properly)

  value (not tested)

- CNORwrapFuzzy.R: fixed pMutation argument that was not populated

- gaDiscrete functions return best score as well in the dataframe.

- output names of the fields returned by gaDiscrete are now using camel
  lower case so that plotFit from CellNoptR can be used

- add C simulator

codelink
--------

Changes in version 1.30.0:

- The most visible change is that the CodelinkSet interface has been
  adopted as the official supported system. Documentation of these
  topic has been improved, and a new vignette describing the
  CodelinkSet system is available (Codelink_Introduction).
  Documentation to the old Codelink class has moved to the
  Codelink_Legacy vignette.

- Before, readCodelink() would assign NA values to spots flagged as M
  (MSR spot), I (Irregular) and C (Contaminated). This could cause in
  large datasets that many spots would have at least one sample with NA
  at random, reducing drastically the number of de facto spots/probes
  used during normalization. Many thanks to Emmanuelle Dantony for
  spotting this problem and subsequent feedback. Because of this and
  other problems implementing and appropriate method to deal with this,
  automatic assigment of NA values is not performed anymore. The only
  exception are M flagged spots, which have intensity values of -9999,
  and hence do not represent any measure of intensity. Also, background
  and normalization methods are applied calling the appropriate
  functions in the limma package. Support for type- and flag-based
  weights has been included, and weights are automatically created by
  readCodelinkSet(). Weights can be used to modulate the contribution
  of some probes to normalization and during linear modeling more
  efficiently. Examples on how to use these approaches are documented
  in the vignette Codelink_Introduction.

- Added generic method normalize() for Codelink and CodelinkSet
  classes.

DART
----

Changes in version 1.7.1:

- Dependency changed from igraph0 to igraph (>=0.6.0) due to archiving
  of igraph0. In file PruneNet.R, the use of clusters() output was
  modified from zero-index to one-index accordingly.

  :)

deltaGseg
---------

Changes in version 1.1.3:

- corrected errors generated in denoiseSegments when segments are too
  small

- refined plotting with data that has many subpopulations (>10)

- more robust argument selection in functions

DESeq2
------

Changes in version 1.1.32:

- By default, use QR decomposition on the design matrix X. This
  stabilizes the GLM fitting. Can be turned off with the useQR argument
  of nbinomWaldTest() and nbinomLRT().

- Allow for "frozen" normalization of new samples using previous
  estimated parameters for the functions: estimateSizeFactors(),
  varianceStabilizingTransformation(), and rlogTransformation(). See
  manual pages for details and examples.

Changes in version 1.1.31:

- The adjustment of p-values and use of Cook's distance for outlier
  detection is moved to results() function instead of nbinomWaldTest(),
  nbinomLRT(), or DESeq(). This allows the user to change parameter
  settings without having to refit the model.

Changes in version 1.1.24:

- The results() function allows the user to specify a contrast of
  coefficients, either using the names of the factor and levels, or
  using a numeric contrast vector. Contrasts are only available for the
  Wald test differential analysis.

Changes in version 1.1.23:

- The results() function automatically performs independent filtering
  using the genefilter package and optimizing over the mean of
  normalized counts.

Changes in version 1.1.21:

- The regularized log transformation uses the fitted dispersions
  instead of the MAP dispersions. This prevents large, true log fold
  changes from being moderated due to a large dispersion estimate blind
  to the design formula. This behavior is also more consistent with the
  variance stabilizing transformation.

DEXSeq
------

Changes in version 2013-09-12:

- Major changes to vignette to provide more of an end-to-end
  description of the work flow.

- Major changes to function names to now make TRT rather than BM the
  default; changed vignette to reflect this.

- Added apepndix explaining TRT to vignette.

Changes in version 2013-02-27:

- A parameter -r was added to the python scripts, that allow the users
  either to ignore the exonic bins belonging to several genes and treat
  the genes separately, or merge the genes into an aggregate gene. The
  equivalent R implementations of the python scripts were finally
  added.

Changes in version 2012-11-28:

- The TRT method is implemented, for people with a big number of
  samples without completions or speed issues

Changes in version 2012-06-26:

- Now any function relies on the order of the levels of the factors.

Changes in version 2012-05-21:

- More options and flexibilty added to "estimatelog2FoldChanges"

Changes in version 2011-10-03:

- Changes to the documentation and to the vignette.  New functions
  added and more support for gene names and strange exonids.

Changes in version 2011-07-12:

- Parallelization possibility added to the code, with its description
  in the vignette and single exon genes ignored properly.

Changes in version 2011-07-01:

- 'estimateSizeFactors' and 'estimatedispersions' function added as S4
  methods, no more problems when loading DESeq and DEXSeq in the same R
  session

DiffBind
--------

- Add support for DESeq2:
  
  * New: Add DBA_DESEQ2, DBA_ALL_METHODS and DBA_ALL_BLOCK method
  constants

  * Change: all reporting and plotting functions support DESeq2 results
  
  * Change: vignette includes comparison of edgeR, DESeq, and DESeq2

- Changes to counting using dba.count:
  
  * Change: optimize built-in counting code to use much less memory and
  run faster
  
  * Change: deprecate bLowMem, replaced with bUseSummarizeOverlaps
  
  * New: add readFormat parameter to specify read file type (instead of
  using file suffix)

- New: generation of result-based DBA object using dba.report (makes it
  easier to work with differentially bound peaksets)

- Changes to defaults:
  
  * Change: default score is now DBA_SCORE_TMM_MINUS_FULL instead of
  DBA_SCORE_TMM_MINUS_EFFECTIVE in dba.count
  
  * Change: default value for bFullLibrarySize is now TRUE in
  dba.analyze
  
  * New: add bCorPlot option to DBA$config to turn off CorPlot by

edgeR
-----

Changes in version 3.3.8:

- predFC() with design=NULL now uses normalization factors correctly.
  However this use of predFC() to compute counts per million is being
  phased out in favour of cpm().

Changes in version 3.3.5:

- Refinement to cutWithMinN() to make the bin numbers more equal in the
  worst case.

- estimateDisp() now creates the design matrix correctly when the
  design matrix is not given as an argument and there is only one
  group.  Previously this case gave an error.

- Minor edit to glm.h code.

Changes in version 3.3.4:

- plotMDS.DGEList now gives a friendly error message when there are
  fewer than 3 data columns.

Changes in version 3.3.3:

- DGEList() accepts NULL as a possible value again for the group,
  lib.size and norm.factors arguments. It is treated the same way as a
  missing argument.

Changes in version 3.3.2:

- Update to cutWithMinN() so that it does not fail even when there are
  many repeated x values.

- Refinement to computation for nbins in dispBinTrend.  Now changes
  more smoothly with the number of genes.  trace argument is retired.

NEW FEATURES

- New flowType using an enhanced dynamic programming algorithm
  implemented in C++, allowing for searching only a subset of the
  phenotype space (to make very high-dimensional data like CyTOF and
  single cell RT-PCR feasible), and to allow the setting of multiple
  levels of expression.

NEW FEATURES

- Note: this version brings some minor but necessary changes to the way
  in which the flowType function is called, which may break backwards
  compatibility for some users. Also note that the return value from
  flowType is no longer compatible with version 1.x of RchyOptimyx;
  users wishing to use RchyOptimyx with flowType 2.x should use the new
  and improved version 2.x of RchyOptimyx, which is actually simpler
  and much more intuitive.

fmcsR
-----

Changes in version 1.4.0:

NEW FEATURES

- Package and fmcsR algorithm published in Bioinformatics (Sep 4, 2013,
  Epub ahead of print)

  (i.e. affy probes)

GeneticsPed
-----------

Changes in version 2007-09-12:

- Added prune function for pruning/trimming the pedigree. It does not
  work on pedigree, but assumes a data.frame with defined structure.
  Adaption needed.

- We depend on genetics package since gpLong2Wide and hwp assume that
  input is of genotype class.

- Added two utility functions (gpLong2Wide and hwp) for work with

- Added some more tests for relationshipAdditive, inverseAdditive and
  inbreeding. # 0.1.2

Changes in version 2007-04-01:

- Now we are more rigorous for value of ascendantSex argument in
  Pedigree(). It must accord to values in sex column, if that one is
  passed of course.

- MASS added to depends due to use of fractions() in many places in
  documnetation.

- Added vignette on quantitative genetic (animal) model and
  model.matrix.Pedigree() functions for educational purposes.

- Created data directory and added pedigree example Mrode2.1 and
  Mrode3.1.

- Added unit tests for genetic relationship matrices that should test
  all related functions - mainly against Mrode's book examples -
  runit.genRelMatrix.R.

  produces a simple summary

- Started to implement checks in check.pedigree and friends

- Proper factor handling

Changes in version 2006-03-16:

  that I messed up some things with factors --> subject to changes. #
  Version 0.1

- Initial version # NEWS ends here

  GRangesList and the unlisted GRanges.

- GenomicRangesUseCases vignette has been redone and renamed to
  GenomicRangesHOWTOs

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

- Defunct all "match" and "%in%" methods in the package except for
  those with the GenomicRanges,GenomicRanges signature.

- Deprecate GappedAlignment*: - GappedAlignments and
  GappedAlignmentPairs classes - GappedAlignments() and
  GappedAlignmentPairs() constructors - readGappedAlignments() and
  readGappedAlignmentPairs() functions

- Deprecate cigar util functions: cigarToWidth(), cigarToQWidth(),

GGtools
-------

Changes in version 4.10:

- Sharply revised vignette

Changes in version 4.9:

- All.cis accepts a CisConfig instance to define parameters of a cis
  search

gmapR
-----

Changes in version 1.4.0:

NEW FEATURES

- Add desired_read_group to BamTallyParam; will limit tallies to that
  specific read group (useful for multi-amplicon sequencing, like
  Fluidigm)

- Add keep_ref_rows argument to variantSummary() for keeping rows for
  positions where no alt is detected (the rows where ref == alt).

- gsnap() will now output a GsnapOutputList when there are multiple
  input files

- Support 'terminal_threshold' and 'gmap_mode' parameters in
  GsnapParam, and use different defaults for DNA vs. RNA. This means a
  big improvement in alignment quality for DNA.

- GmapGenome now accepts a direct path to the genome as its first
  argument

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- Renamed summarizeVariants to variantSummary

- The 'which' in GsnapParam is now a GenomicRanges instead of a
  RangesList

- Refactor bam_tally, so that bam_tally returns a TallyIIT object,
  which is then summarized via summarizeVariants; this allows computing
  tallies once and summarizing them in different ways (like maybe get
  the coverage). The summarizeVariants function yields a VRanges.

BUG FIXES

- fix minimum quality cutoff check to >=, instead of >

- fix asBam,GsnapOutput for when unique_only is TRUE

- package created by makeGmapGenomePackage now have a GmapGenome with

IRanges
-------

Changes in version 1.20.0:

NEW FEATURES

- Add IntervalForest class from Hector Corrada Bravo.

- Add a FilterMatrix class, for holding the results of multiple
  filters.

- Add selfmatch() as a faster equivalent of 'match(x, x)'.

- Add "c" method for Views objects (only combine objects with same
  subject).

- Add coercion from SimpleRangesList to SimpleIRangesList.

- Add an `%outside%` that is the opposite of `%over%`.

- Add validation of length() and names() of Vector objects.

- Add "duplicated" and "table" methods for Vector objects.

- Add some split methods that dispatch to splitAsList() even when only
  'f' is a Vector.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- All functionalities related to XVector objects have been moved to the
  new XVector package.

- Refine how isDisjoint() handles empty ranges.

- Remove 'keepLength' argument from "window<-" methods.

- unlist( , use.names=FALSE) on a CompressedSplitDataFrameList object
  now preserves the rownames of the list elements, which is more
  consistent with what unlist() does on other CompressedList objects.

- Splitting a list by a Vector just yields a list, not a List.

- The rbind,DataFrame method now handles the case where Rle and vector
  columns need to be combined (assuming an equivalence between Rle and
  vector). Also the way the result DataFrame is constructed was changed
  (avoids undesirable coercions and should be faster).

- as.data.frame.DataFrame now passes 'stringsAsFactors=FALSE' and
  'check.names=!optional' to the underlying data.frame() call.
  as(x,"DataFrame") sets 'optional=TRUE' when delegating. Most places
  where we called as.data.frame(), we now call 'as(x,"data.frame")'.

- The [<-,DataFrame method now coerces column sub-replacement value to
  class of column when the column already exists.

- DataFrame() now automatically derives rownames (from the first
  argument that has some). This is a fairly significant change in
  behavior, but it probably does better match user behavior.

- Make sure that SimpleList objects are coerced to a DataFrame with a
  single column. The automatic coecion methods created by the methods
  package were trying to create a DataFrame with one column per
  element, because DataFrame extends SimpleList.

- Change default to 'compress=TRUE' for RleList() constructor.

- tapply() now handles the case where only INDEX is a Vector (e.g.  an
  Rle object).

- Speedup coverage() in the "tiling case" (i.e. when 'x' is a tiling of
  the [1, width] interval). This makes it much faster to turn into an
  Rle a coverage loaded from a BigWig, WIG or BED as a GRanges object.

- Allow logical Rle return values from filter rules.

- FilterRules no longer requires its elements to be named.

- The select,Vector method now returns a DataFrame even when a single
  column is selected.

- Move is.unsorted() generic to BiocGenerics.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

- Deprecate seqselect() and subsetByRanges().

- Deprecate 'match.if.overlap' arg of "match" method for Ranges
  objects.

- "match" and "%in%" methods that operate on Views, ViewsList,
  RangesList, or RangedData objects (20 methods in total) are now
  defunct.

- Remove previously defunct tofactor().

BUG FIXES

- The subsetting code for Vector derivatives was substancially
  refactored.  As a consequence, it's now cleaner, simpler, and [ and
  [[ behave more consistently across Vector derivatives. Some obscure
  long-standing bugs have been eliminated and the code can be slightly
  faster in some circumstances.

- Fix bug in findOverlaps(); zero-width ranges in the query no longer
  produce hits ever (regardless of 'maxgap' and 'minoverlap' values).

- Correctly free memory allocated for linked list of results compiled
  for findOverlap(select="all").

- Various fixes for AsIs and DataFrames.

- Allow zero-row replacement values in [<-,DataFrame.

- Fix long standing segfault in "[" method for Rle objects (when doing
  Rle()[0]).

- "show" methods now display its most specific class when a column or
  slot is an S3 object for which class() returns more than one class.

- "show" methods now display properly cells that are arrays.

- Fix the [<-,DataFrame method for when a value DataFrame has matrix
  columns.

- Fix ifelse() for when one or more of the arguments are Rle objects.

- Fix coercion from SimpleList to CompressedList via AtomicList
  constructors.

- Make "show" methods robust to "showHeadLines" and "showTailLines"
  global options set to NA, Inf or non-integer values.

- Fix error condition in eval,FilterRules method.

- Corrected an error formatting in eval,FilterRules,ANY method.

Rsubread
--------

Changes in version 1.12.0:

NEW FEATURES

  function, including reordering of reads in BAM files to make reads
  from the same pair be adjacent to each other, support for chromosome
  aliases and output of complete annotation data for counting results
  from meta-feature level summarization.

NEW FEATURES

- It is described in more details in the Users Guide on how
  featureCounts program summarizes reads.

NEW FEATURES

- Improved short indel detection for both Subread (align function) and
  Subjunc aligners. This was achieved by building a consensus indel
  table and by realigning the reads. Discovered indels are reported in
  the output in addition to the read mapping results.

NEW FEATURES

- Support for detection of long indels (up to 200bp) was added in
  Subread. When the specified value of `indels' argument is greater
  than 16, Subread will automatically perform read assembly to detect
  long insertions and deletions.

NEW FEATURES

- Subread and Subjunc can now take FASTQ/FASTA, SAM and BAM files as
  input and output mapping results in both SAM and BAM formats.

NEW FEATURES

- Subjunc now directly operates on raw read data (it previously took
  Subread output as input), thus reducing running time by nearly half.

NEW FEATURES

- Subjunc can be instructed to output uniquely mapped reads. Hamming
  distance and mapping quality scores can be used to break ties when
  more than one best location was found.

- Corrected a bug that could affect results when multiple fasta files
  are assigned to a same taxon.

RTCA
----

Changes in version 2009-07-13:

- combineRTCA(list): Additional column is renamed into Plate. The vlues
  is evaluated from list item names. When the list has no name, an
  integer index beginning from 1 is used. Special attentions to list
  partially with names is noted in the documentation.

- parseRTCA(file, dec=".",phenoData, skipWell,...): Example is added in
  the documentation how to import pre-configured phenoData. Details
  section in the documentation is re-written to describe the process of
  parsing.

- RTCA-class: Experiment ID added to RTCA class

- Makefile: add Makefile to simplify common tasks like check and
  install

- plotGridEffect: takes 'column' instead of 'col' as mode parameter,
  and renders the mode as the title of the legend. Documentation
  updated.

- plotRTCA: is removed from the package and is substituted by the plot
  function.

RTN
---

Changes in version 1.0.0:

- 1st Bioconductor release of RTN [2013-10-15].

rtracklayer
-----------

Changes in version 1.22:

NEW FEATURES

- import,BigWigFile gains an asRle parameter that returns the data as
  an RleList (assuming it tiles the sequence); much faster than
  importing a GRanges and calling coverage() on it.

- add export,RleList,BigWigFile method for direct (and much more
  efficient) output of RleLists (like coverage) to BigWig files.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- UCSCData now extends GRanges instead of RangedData (thanks Herve)

BUG FIXES

- handle different Set-Cookie header field casing; often due to proxies
  (thanks to Altuna Akalin)

- attempt to more gracefully handle UCSC truncation of large data
  downloads

- handle re-directs due to UCSC mirroring (thanks Martin Morgan)

rTRM
----

Changes in version 1.0:

SBMLR
-----

Changes in version 1.57.1:

NEW FEATURES

- Added new function S4toS3() for converting S4 SBML models of rsbml
  into S3 SBMLR models.

- Includes code from Vishak Venkateswaran's branch of SBMLR on github
  (July 2011). This is may allow it to read more models in
  http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/ I say may because I don't fully
  understand all of his codes, but add it in anyway.

- Problem of libsbml allowing multiple args to multiplication operator
  was solved by using prod(). Similarly for sum(). Note that "*"() is
  strictly a binary operator.

SIGNIFICANT USER-LEVEL CHANGES

- Call my model object call SBMLR now to let SBML refer to rsbml's SBML
  object. Similary my simulate() is now sim() to keep it clear of
  rsbml's simulate().

- SBMLR model files no longer need to have the reversible flag set. The
  default is FALSE, which is the opposite of Level 2: all of my
  reaction rate laws have always been positive, and a design objective
  I like is to keep SBMLR model files as lean as possible (subject to
  the constraint that they be valid R code).

- Simulate handles lsoda() event dataframes, see simulate help.

- curtoNatural.R (see Fig. 7 BMC Bioinformatics 2004, 5:190) is now in
  the models folder.

- The SOD model of Kowald et al, JTB 238 (2006) 828–840 is now also in
  this folder.

- Two pdfs of publications that are freely available were removed to
  make the package lighter.

- Similarly, only manual.doc remains: its redundant pdf is now out.

Notes

- SBMLR objects do need to have their reversible flag set in files, but
  do in SBMLR objects in R.

  across multiple cores on a single computer or across multiple
  computers on a cluster.

- Ability to generate RNA-Seq annotation files to be used with the

  rather than then entire file; use sample=FALSE to revert to previous
  behavior.

NEW FEATURES

- encoding,FastqQuality and encoding,SFastqQuality provide a convenient
  map between letter encodings and their corresponding integer quality
  values.

VariantAnnotation
-----------------

Changes in version 1.8.0:

NEW FEATURES

- Add 'upstream' and 'downstream' arguments to IntergenicVariants()
  constructor.

- Add 'samples' argument to ScanVcfParam().

- Add readGT(), readGeno() and readInfo().

- Add VRanges, VRangesList, SimpleVRangesList, and
  CompressedVRangesList classes.

- Add coercion VRanges -> VCF and VCF -> VRanges.

- Add methods for VRanges family: altDepth(), refDepth(), totalDepth(),
  altFraction() called(), hardFilters(), sampleNames(),
  softFilterMatrix() isIndel(), resetFilter().

- Add stackedSamples,VRangesList method.

MODIFICATIONS

- VCF validity method now requires the number of rows in info() to
  match the length of rowData().

- PRECEDEID and FOLLOWID from locateVariants() are now CharacterLists
  with all genes in 'upstream' and 'downstream' range.

- Modify rownames on rowData() GRanges to CHRAM:POS_REF/ALT for
  variants with no ID.

- readVcf() returns info() and geno() in the order specified in the
  ScanVcfParam.

- Work on scanVcf(): - free parse memory at first opportunity - define
  it_next in .c rather than .h - parse ALT "." in C - hash incoming
  strings - parse only param-requested 'fixed', 'info', 'geno' fields

- Add dimnames<-,VCF method to prevent 'fixed' fields from being copied
  into 'rowData' when new rownames or colnames were assigned.

- Support read/write for an emtpy VCF.

- readVcf(file=character, ...) method attempts coercion to TabixFile.

- Support for read/write an emtpy VCF.

- Add performance section to vignette; convert to BiocStyle.

- expand,CompressedVcf method expands geno() field 'AD' to length ALT +
  1. The expanded field is a (n x y x 2) array.

- 'genome' argument to readVcf() can be a character(1) or Seqinfo
  object.

DEPRECATED and DEFUNCT

- Defunct dbSNPFilter(), regionFilter() and MatrixToSnpMatrix().

- Deprecate readVcfLongForm().

BUG FIXES

- Fix bug in compatibility of read/writeVcf() when no INFO are columns
  present.

- Fix bug in locateVariants() when 'features' has no txid and cdsid.

- Fix bug in asVCF() when writing header lines.

- Fix bug in "expand" methods for VCF to handle multiple 'A' columns in
  info().

VariantTools
------------

Changes in version 1.4:

NEW FEATURES

- tallyVariants will now keep ref rows if variant_strand=0; this is
  useful for getting information when no alts are present (e.g., for
  making wildtype calls). Better have a big cluster to do this over the
  whole genome.

- add a keep_extra_stats param to TallyVariantsParam; setting this to
  FALSE will speed things up when the extra stats are not needed.

- idVerify now supports VCF input like that output by GATK.

- callableFraction() now supports GRangesList and TranscriptDb.

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- The API is now based on VRanges, a formal GRanges-derived class for
  representing variants; use of so-called "tally" or "variant" GRanges
  is deprecated.

- Disable proximity filter by default; we recommend this now only for
  whole genome calling.

- QA filtering is no longer a formal part of the calling pipeline; we
  recommend to apply QA filters "softly" via qaVariants() and use the
  results for diagnostics only.

- Use BiocParallel (BPPARAM argument) for tallyVariants

- VariantTallyParam deprecated; use TallyVariantsParam

BUG FIXES

- idVerify now correctly computes cliques instead of connected
  components

- use the total count, rather than the ref count when calculating the
  alt frequency

  the modifications in rev 65169 and caused features to be aligned that
  were far outside the given m/z and retention time windows.

Changes in version 1.37.1:

BUG FIXES

- fixed fillPeaks, which 1) dropped non-standard columns and 2) failed
  if nothing to do, based on patches by Tony Larson.
