1. Install R >=3.6.0.  Bioconductor 3.9 has been designed expressly for
   this version of R.

2. Follow the instructions at
   [http://bioconductor.org/install/](http://bioconductor.org/install/).

New Software Packages
=====================

There are 105 new software packages in this release of Bioconductor.

- [ADAM](https://bioconductor.org/packages/ADAM) ADAM is a GSEA R
  package created to group a set of genes from comparative samples
  (control versus experiment) belonging to different species
  according to their respective functions (Gene Ontology and KEGG
  pathways as default) and show their significance by calculating
  p-values referring togene diversity and activity. Each group of
  genes is called GFAG (Group of Functionally Associated Genes).

- [ADAMgui](https://bioconductor.org/packages/ADAMgui) ADAMgui is a
  Graphical User Interface for the ADAM package. The ADAMgui package
  provides 2 shiny-based applications that allows the user to study
  the output of the ADAM package files through different plots. It's
  possible, for example, to choose a specific GFAG and observe the
  gene expression behavior with the plots created with the
  GFAGtargetUi function. Features such as differential expression and
  foldchange can be easily seen with aid of the plots made with
  GFAGpathUi function.

- [adductomicsR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/adductomicsR)
  Processes MS2 data to identify potentially adducted peptides from
  spectra that has been corrected for mass drift and retention time
  drift and quantifies MS1 level mass spectral peaks.

- [alevinQC](https://bioconductor.org/packages/alevinQC) Generate QC
  reports summarizing the output from an alevin run. Reports can be
  generated as html or pdf files, or as shiny applications.

- [AMARETTO](https://bioconductor.org/packages/AMARETTO) Integrating
  an increasing number of available multi-omics cancer data remains
  one of the main challenges to improve our understanding of cancer.
  One of the main challenges is using multi-omics data for
  identifying novel cancer driver genes. We have developed an
  algorithm, called AMARETTO, that integrates copy number, DNA
  methylation and gene expression data to identify a set of driver
  genes by analyzing cancer samples and connects them to clusters of
  co-expressed genes, which we define as modules. We applied AMARETTO
  in a pancancer setting to identify cancer driver genes and their
  modules on multiple cancer sites. AMARETTO captures modules
  enriched in angiogenesis, cell cycle and EMT, and modules that
  accurately predict survival and molecular subtypes. This allows
  AMARETTO to identify novel cancer driver genes directing canonical
  cancer pathways.

- [animalcules](https://bioconductor.org/packages/animalcules)
  animalcules is an R package for utilizing up-to-date data
  analytics, visualization methods, and machine learning models to

  can explore their data with the accompanying interactive R Shiny
  application. Traditional microbiome analysis such as alpha/beta
  diversity and differential abundance analysis are enhanced, while
  new methods like biomarker identification are introduced by
  animalcules. Powerful interactive and dynamic figures generated by
  animalcules enable users to understand their data better and
  discover new insights.

- [atSNP](https://bioconductor.org/packages/atSNP) atSNP performs

  Bayesian hierarchical model for detecting differential splicing of
  genes and transcripts, via differential transcript usage (DTU),
  between two or more conditions. The method uses a Bayesian
  hierarchical framework, which allows for sample specific
  proportions in a Dirichlet-Multinomial model, and samples the
  allocation of fragments to the transcripts. Parameters are inferred
  via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques and a DTU test is
  performed via a multivariate Wald test on the posterior densities
  for the average relative abundance of transcripts.

- [batchelor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/batchelor) Implements
  a variety of methods for batch correction of single-cell (RNA
  sequencing) data. This includes methods based on detecting mutually
  nearest neighbors as well as a simple sparsity-preserving

  batches, and to perform a principal components analysis that is
  robust to differences in the numbers of cells across different
  batches.

- [bigPint](https://bioconductor.org/packages/bigPint) Methods for
  visualizing large multivariate datasets using static and
  interactive scatterplot matrices, parallel coordinate plots,

  CNVRanger package implements a comprehensive tool suite for CNV
  analysis. This includes functionality for summarizing individual
  CNV calls across a population, assessing overlap with functional
  genomic regions, and association analysis with gene expression and
  quantitative phenotypes.

- [cola](https://bioconductor.org/packages/cola) Subgroup
  classification is a basic task in genomic data analysis, especially
  for gene expression data and methylation data. It can predict novel
  subgroups when there is nothing known about the data or it can test
  consistency between predicted subgroups with known annotations. The
  cola package provides a general framework for subgroup
  classification by consensus clustering. It has following features: 1. It modularizes the consensus clustering processes that various
  methods can be easily integrated. 2. It provides rich
  visualizations for interpreting the results. 3. It allows running
  multiple methods at the same time and provides functionalities to

  Uses quadratic programming for signature refitting, i.e., to
  decompose the mutation catalog from an individual tumor sample into
  a set of given mutational signatures (either Alexandrov-model
  signatures or Shiraishi-model signatures), computing weights that
  reflect the contributions of the signatures to the mutation load of
  the tumor.

- [DelayedDataFrame](https://bioconductor.org/packages/DelayedDataFrame)
  Based on the standard DataFrame metaphor, we are trying to
  implement the feature of delayed operation on the DelayedDataFrame,
  with a slot of lazyIndex, which saves the mapping indexes for each
  column of DelayedDataFrame. Methods like show, validity check, [/[[
  subsetting, rbind/cbind are implemented for DelayedDataFrame to be
  operated around lazyIndex. The listData slot stays untouched until
  a realization call e.g., DataFrame constructor OR as.list() is
  invoked.

- [DeMixT](https://bioconductor.org/packages/DeMixT) DeMixT is a
  software package that performs deconvolution on transcriptome data
  from a mixture of two or three components.

  of this package is to identify traits in a dataset that can
  separate groups. This is done on two levels. First, clustering is
  performed, using an implementation of sparse K-means. Secondly, the
  generated clusters are used to predict outcomes of groups of
  individuals based on their distribution of observations in the
  different clusters. As certain clusters with separating information
  will be identified, and these clusters are defined by a sparse
  number of variables, this method can reduce the complexity of data,
  to only emphasize the data that actually matters.

- [DiscoRhythm](https://bioconductor.org/packages/DiscoRhythm) Set of
  functions for estimation of cyclical characteristics, such as
  period, phase, amplitude, and statistical significance in large
  temporal datasets. Supporting functions are available for quality
  control, dimensionality reduction, spectral analysis, and analysis
  of experimental replicates. Contains a R Shiny web interface to
  execute all workflow steps.

- [divergence](https://bioconductor.org/packages/divergence) This
  package provides functionality for performing divergence analysis
  as presented in Dinalankara et al, "Digitizing omics profiles by
  divergence from a baseline", PANS 2018. This allows the user to
  simplify high dimensional omics data into a binary or ternary
  format which encapsulates how the data is divergent from a
  specified baseline group with the same univariate or multivariate
  features.

- [DNABarcodeCompatibility](https://bioconductor.org/packages/DNABarcodeCompatibility)
  The package allows one to obtain optimized combinations of DNA
  barcodes to be used for multiplex sequencing. In each barcode
  combination, barcodes are pooled with respect to Illumina chemistry
  constraints. Combinations can be filtered to keep those that are
  robust against substitution and insertion/deletion errors thereby
  facilitating the demultiplexing step. In addition, the package
  provides an optimizer function to further favor the selection of
  barcode combinations with least redundancy of DNA barcodes.

  specific subsets of genes, broad utility in systems biology
  research. doseR has been prepared to manage the nature of the data
  and the desired set of inferences. doseR uses S4 classes to store
  count data from sequencing experiment. It contains functions to
  normalize and filter count data, as well as to plot and calculate
  statistics of count data. It contains a framework for linear
  modeling of count data. The package has been tested using real and
  simulated data.

- [enrichTF](https://bioconductor.org/packages/enrichTF) As
  transcription factors (TFs) play a crucial role in regulating the
  transcription process through binding on the genome alone or in a
  combinatorial manner, TF enrichment analysis is an efficient and
  important procedure to locate the candidate functional TFs from a
  set of experimentally defined regulatory regions. While it is
  commonly accepted that structurally related TFs may have similar
  binding preference to sequences (i.e. motifs) and one TF may have
  multiple motifs, TF enrichment analysis is much more challenging
  than motif enrichment analysis. Here we present a R package for TF
  enrichment analysis which combine motif enrichment with the PECA
  model.

- [epihet](https://bioconductor.org/packages/epihet) epihet is an
  R-package that calculates the epigenetic heterogeneity between
  cancer cells and/or normal cells. The functions establish a
  pipeline that take in bisulfite sequencing data from multiple
  samples and use the data to track similarities and differences in
  epipolymorphism,proportion of discordantly methylated sequencing
  reads (PDR),and Shannon entropy values at epialleles that are
  shared between the samples.epihet can be used to perform analysis
  on the data by creating pheatmaps, box plots, PCA plots, and t-SNE
  plots. MA plots can also be created by calculating the differential
  heterogeneity of the samples. And we construct co-epihet network
  and perform network analysis.

  inside a redistributable R package. The package contains two main
  algorithms; lncRNA2GOA and TopoICSim. lncRNA2GOA tries to annotate
  novel genes (in this specific case lncRNAs) by using various
  correlation/geometric scoring methods on correlated expression
  data. After correlating/scoring, the results are annotated and
  enriched. TopoICSim is a topologically based method, that compares
  gene similarity based on the topology of the GO DAG by information
  content (IC) between GO terms.

- [GladiaTOX](https://bioconductor.org/packages/GladiaTOX) GladiaTOX

  package produces metagene plots to compare coverages of sequencing
  experiments at selected groups of genomic regions. It can be used
  for such analyses as assessing the binding of DNA-interacting
  proteins at promoter regions or surveying antisense transcription
  over the length of a gene. The metagene2 package can manage all
  aspects of the analysis, from normalization of coverages to plot
  facetting according to experimental metadata. Bootstraping analysis

  and conduct survival analysis of modules.

- [mnem](https://bioconductor.org/packages/mnem) Mixture Nested
  Effects Models (mnem) is an extension of Nested Effects Models and
  allows for the analysis of single cell perturbation data provided
  by methods like Perturb-Seq (Dixit et al., 2016) or Crop-Seq
  (Datlinger et al., 2017). In those experiments each of many cells
  is perturbed by a knock-down of a specific gene, i.e. several cells
  are perturbed by a knock-down of gene A, several by a knock-down of
  gene B, ... and so forth. The observed read-out has to be
  multi-trait and in the case of the Perturb-/Crop-Seq gene are
  expression profiles for each cell. mnem uses a mixture model to
  simultaneously cluster the cell population into k clusters and and
  infer k networks causally linking the perturbed genes for each
  cluster. The mixture components are inferred via an expectation
  maximization algorithm.

- [Modstrings](https://bioconductor.org/packages/Modstrings)
  Representing nucleotide modifications in a nucleotide sequence is
  usually done via special characters from a number of sources. This
  represents a challenge to work with in R and the Biostrings
  package. The Modstrings package implements this functionallity for
  RNA and DNA sequences containing modified nucleotides by
  translating the character internally in order to work with the
  infrastructure of the Biostrings package. For this the ModRNAString
  and ModDNAString classes and derivates and functions to construct
  and modify these objects despite the encoding issues are
  implemenented. In addition the conversion from sequences to list
  like location information (and the reverse operation) is
  implemented as well.

- [MOFA](https://bioconductor.org/packages/MOFA) Multi-Omics Factor
  Analysis: an unsupervised framework for the integration of
  multi-omics data sets.

- [nanotatoR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/nanotatoR) Whole
  genome sequencing (WGS) has successfully been used to identify
  single-nucleotide variants (SNV), small insertions and deletions
  and, more recently, small copy number variants. However, due to
  utilization of short reads, it is not well suited for
  identification of structural variants (SV) and the majority of SV
  calling tools having high false positive and negative rates.Optical
  next-generation mapping (NGM) utilizes long fluorescently labeled
  native-state DNA molecules for de novo genome assembly to overcome
  the limitations of WGS. NGM allows for a significant increase in SV
  detection capability. However, accuracy of SV annotation is highly
  important for variant classification and filtration to determine
  pathogenicity.Here we create a new tool in R, for SV annotation,
  including population frequency and gene function and expression,
  using publicly available datasets. We use DGV (Database of Genomic
  Variants), to calculate the population frequency of the SVs
  identified by the Bionano SVCaller in the NGM dataset of a cohort
  of 50 undiagnosed patients with a variety of phenotypes. The new
  annotation tool, nanotatoR, also calculates the internal frequency
  of SVs, which could be beneficial in identification of potential
  false positive or common calls. The software creates a primary gene
  list (PG) from NCBI databases based on patient phenotype and
  compares the list to the set of genes overlapping the patient’s SVs
  generated by SVCaller, providing analysts with an easy way to
  identify variants affecting genes in the PG. The output is given in
  an Excel file format, which is subdivided into multiple sheets
  based on SV type. Users then have a choice to filter SVs using the
  provided annotation for identification of inherited, de novo or
  rare variants. nanotatoR provides integrated annotation and the
  expression patterns to enable users to identify potential
  pathogenic SVs with greater precision and faster turnaround times.

- [NBAMSeq](https://bioconductor.org/packages/NBAMSeq)
  High-throughput sequencing experiments followed by differential
  expression analysis is a widely used approach to detect genomic
  biomarkers. A fundamental step in differential expression analysis
  is to model the association between gene counts and covariates of
  interest. NBAMSeq a flexible statistical model based on the
  generalized additive model and allows for information sharing
  across genes in variance estimation.

- [netboost](https://bioconductor.org/packages/netboost) Boosting

  package provides methods and object classes for parsing FastQC
  reports and output summaries from other NGS tools into R, as well
  as visualising the data loaded from these files.

- [OmicsLonDA](https://bioconductor.org/packages/OmicsLonDA)
  Statistical method that provides robust identification of time
  intervals where omics features (such as proteomics, lipidomics,
  metabolomics, transcriptomics, microbiome, as well as physiological
  parameters captured by wearable sensors such as heart rhythm, body
  temperature, and activity level) are significantly different
  between groups.

- [OVESEG](https://bioconductor.org/packages/OVESEG) An R package for
  multiple-group comparison to detect tissue/cell-specific marker
  genes among subtypes. It provides functions to compute OVESEG-test

  output and assigns SNPs to genes, uses those genes to find pathways
  associated with the genes, and plots pathways based on
  significance. Implements methods for reading GWAS input data,
  finding genes associated with SNPs, calculating enrichment score
  and significance of pathways, and plotting pathways.

- [pathwayPCA](https://bioconductor.org/packages/pathwayPCA) Apply
  the Supervised PCA and Adaptive, Elastic-Net, Sparse PCA methods to
  extract principal components from each pathway. Use these pathway-
  specific principal components as the design matrix relating the
  response to each pathway. Return the model fit statistic p-values,
  and adjust these values for False Discovery Rate. Return a data
  frame of the pathways sorted by their adjusted p-values. This
  package has corresponding vignettes hosted in the ''User Guides''
  page of <https://gabrielodom.github.io/pathwayPCA/index.html>, and
  the website for the development information is hosted at
  <https://github.com/gabrielodom/pathwayPCA>.

- [PCAtools](https://bioconductor.org/packages/PCAtools) Principal
  Components Analysis (PCA) is a very powerful technique that has
  wide applicability in data science, bioinformatics, and further
  afield. It was initially developed to analyse large volumes of data
  in order to tease out the differences/relationships between the
  logical entities being analysed. It extracts the fundamental
  structure of the data without the need to build any model to
  represent it. This 'summary' of the data is arrived at through a
  process of reduction that can transform the large number of
  variables into a lesser number that are uncorrelated, i.e., the
  principal components, whilst at the same time being capable of easy
  interpretation on the original data.

- [phemd](https://bioconductor.org/packages/phemd) Package for
  comparing and generating a low-dimensional embedding of multiple
  single-cell samples.

- [pipeFrame](https://bioconductor.org/packages/pipeFrame) pipeFrame
  is an R package for building a componentized bioinformatics
  pipeline. Each step in this pipeline is wrapped in the framework,
  so the connection among steps is created seamlessly and
  automatically. Users could focus more on fine-tuning arguments
  rather than spending a lot of time on transforming file format,
  passing task outputs to task inputs or installing the dependencies.
  Componentized step elements can be customized into other new
  pipelines flexibly as well. This pipeline can be split into several
  important functional steps, so it is much easier for users to
  understand the complex arguments from each step rather than
  parameter combination from the whole pipeline. At the same time,
  componentized pipeline can restart at the breakpoint and avoid
  rerunning the whole pipeline, which may save a lot of time for
  users on pipeline tuning or such issues as power off or process
  other interrupts.

- [PoTRA](https://bioconductor.org/packages/PoTRA) The PoTRA analysis
  is based on topological ranks of genes in biological pathways.
  PoTRA can be used to detect pathways involved in disease (Li, Liu &
  Dinu, 2018). We use PageRank to measure the relative topological
  ranks of genes in each biological pathway, then select hub genes
  for each pathway, and use Fishers Exact test to determine if the
  number of hub genes in each pathway is altered from normal to
  cancer (Li, Liu & Dinu, 2018). Alternatively, if the distribution
  of topological ranks of gene in a pathway is altered between normal
  and cancer, this pathway might also be involved in cancer (Li, Liu
  & Dinu, 2018). Hence, we use the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test to detect
  pathways that have an altered distribution of topological ranks of
  genes between two phenotypes (Li, Liu & Dinu, 2018). PoTRA can be
  used with the KEGG, Biocarta, Reactome, NCI, SMPDB and PharmGKB
  databases from the devel graphite library.

[CAGEfightR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/CAGEfightR)
----------

                         Changes in version 1.5                         

- Added new functions for spatial analysis of clusters: findLinks finds
  nearby pairs of clusters (for example TSSs and enhancers) and
  calculates the correlation of expression between them. findStretches
  find stretches along the genome where clusters are within a certain
  distance of eachother (for example groups of enhancer forming a super
  enhancer) and calculates the average pairwise correlation between
  members.

- Changed the way clustering works: CAGEfightR uses coverage() to
  calculate genome-wide signals and now rounds the resulting signal to
  a certain number of digits (this can be modified via the
  CAGEfightR.round option), to prevent small positive or negative
  values due to floating point errors. This makes clustering more
  stable meaning the tuneTagClustering function is now deprecated. This
  should also increase the speed of most functions.

- CAGEfightR now uses GPos instead of GRanges for storing CTSSs, this
  should result in improved memory performance.

- Several changes to clusterBidirectionality: Balance is now calculated
  using the midpoint as well (preventing some rare cases where the
  midpoint could mask a single highly expressed CTSS), the pooled CTSS
  signal is now prefiltered for bidirectionality to increase speed and
  custom balance function can be provided (Bhattacharyya coefficient
  and Andersson's D are included).

- Added new check-functions to make it easier to check if objects are
  formatted correctly

- fn_arg_seq() now has a .strict argument to check if arguments
supplied are actually used in the function. Default is FALSE,
previously this check is always done, but it failed for functions
that use methods dispatch.  - pipeline_collapse() now has a data.name
argument for if the name of the dataset should be kept in the
pipeline string. Useful if only one dataset is used.  - arrow_sep()
now uses ascii glyphs (only left and right available) instead of
unicode. Unicode arrows fail when ggplots in rmarkdown is compiled
into PDF, a common enough use-case for this to be concerning.

[decompTumor2Sig](https://bioconductor.org/packages/decompTumor2Sig)
---------------

                 Changes in version 1.99.1 (2019-04-07)                 

- Changed the procedure which converts lists of individual mutations
  from MPF files into tumor mutation profiles to reduce the memory
  footprint and allow for larger sets of tumors to be read from file.

- When genomes are read from files: remove genomes without SNVs (no
  mutation frequencies)

- Recognize indels for which either the REF or ALT base is specified as
  "-"

- Fix bugs: o Error when quadprog returned a mutation frequency of
  minimally larger than 1 (which is theoretically impossible but can
  probably happen due to the rounding of floating point numbers)

                 Changes in version 1.99.0 (2018-11-10)                 

- When transcription direction is taken into account: exclude mutations
  in regions with overlapping genes of opposing transcription
  directions by default! Previous versions of decompTumor2Sig took the
  approach of pmsignature, using the transcription direction of the
  first gene encountered in the transcript database (which is rather
  arbitrary); excluding these mutations appears more appropriate. The
  old approach can still be used with an additional function parameter.

- Removed pmsignature from the suggested packages (not allowed in
  Bioconductor)

- Reduced the number of tumor genome examples in extdata for faster
  processing and smaller package size (six out of 21 tumors from
  PMID:22608084)

                 Changes in version 1.3.3 (2018-09-24)                  

- Implemented own signature plotting to remove code dependency from
  pmsignature

- Decoupled the following data conversions functions from pmsignature
  code: o getGenomesFromMutFeatData() o getSignaturesFromEstParam()

- Moved some common code to a new internal function for ease of
  maintenance.

- Fixed bugs: o Error when some sequence names where not found in the
  reference genome, e.g., due to different names of decoy sequences. o
  Minor problems with unlikely signatures composed of only the mutated
  base (no flanking bases)

                 Changes in version 1.3.2 (2018-08-29)                  

- Fixed a minor bug in mapSignatureSets() that occurred when the two
  signature sets had the same size.

- Added functions to verify the format of signatures, genomes and
  exposures: o isAlexandrovSet(), isShiraishiSet(), isSignatureSet() o
  sameSignatureFormat() o isExposureSet()

- Moved description of deprecated BiocInstaller in vignette to
  BiocManager.

                 Changes in version 1.3.1 (2018-08-15)                  

- Updated DESCRIPTION file o replaced Author and Maintainer by
  Authors@R o added URL for BugReports

- Changed from manual NAMESPACE and *Rd files to a creation by roxygen2

- Changed function names for reading data from "load..." to "read..."

- Shortened the longest function names o
  getGenomesFromMutationFeatureData -> getGenomesFromMutFeatData o
  getSignatureListFromEstimatedParameters -> getSignaturesFromEstParam

- Used robust sequence creation with seq, seq_len, seq_along instead of
  1:N etc

- Consistent use of native class checking such as is.numeric()

- Implemented wrapper functions for external classes which do not
  provide the necessary accessor functions

- Replaced instances of sapply() and unlist(lapply()) by vapply()

- Updated vignette and made most code chunks runnable

- Added greedy search option to plotExplainedVariance (significant
  speed-up)

                 Changes in version 1.0.0 (2018-02-13)                  

Added

- Installation chapter to main vignette.

- Extra tests.

- Basic user input checks.

- Tests for checking precalculated matrices versions.

- Package added to Bioconductor

- Extra script for potential addition in the future (chromosome
  position calculations. File is in inst folder: "chrom_pos.R")

Changed

  environment first).

- The way TopoICSim is calculated for genes/genelists, skipping certain
  unnecessary calculations, improving performance greatly.

- `apply` functions.

- How test results are stored -> they are now stored in a list instead
  of seperately.

- Examples, tests and vignette calculations to make sure they don't
  last too long.

- Readme, more verbose.

- Vignettes/Documentation - typo fixes and general small improvements.

Removed

- All global assignments.

- Class accessors (where possible).

Fixed

- "Fixed" news file to plain text format.

- Precalculated topoicsim matrix.

- Compliance with R CMD check.

- Compliance with R CMD BiocCheck.

- Dependency issues.

- Download function of fantom data.

- Fantom 5 functions.

- Calculation time output (actually in seconds now).

                 Changes in version 0.3.0 (2018-11-22)                  

Added

- Re-added data which lncRNApred's paper is based on.

- Support for all AnnotationDbi Key types.

- Vignette for GAPGOM.

- Vignette for benchmarks/performance measuring.

- Term algorithm as exported function.

- Set go data as exported function.

- Some frequently used params can now be set manually (go_data,
  All_Go_pairs).

- Seperate scoring function (If people want to do their own
  enrichment/only get semantic similarity scores).

- Some more arguments for the algorithms to make the user have more
  control.

- Custom gene interface for topoicsim.

Changed

- `DESCRIPTION` file, now adheres to some smaller requirements
  Bioconductor enforces.

- Topoicsim for gene and geneset are now 1 generic function
  `topo_ic_sim_genes`.

- Documentation and comments (again).

- Argument parsing for topoicsim.

- Some tests and their results.

- Used arguments in both algorithms.

- Precalculated values are deprecated for this version and thus turned
  off, warning gets shown if it is tried to be used anyway. The values
  will be updated in upcoming releases and probably adhere to only
  certain `org.db` package versions (with a warning shown if incorrect
  versions are used).

- Some `lapply` loops, now for loops, as they were using global
  assignments and this is forbidden/unfavorable in conventions.

- Updated data-raw files, they now work properly for current version
  and are better documented.

Removed

- All forms of parallelization support. It was buggy/inconsistent and
  where it could be implemented insignificant performance gains were
  made.

- Direct interface from fantom5 file to expset
  `fantom_load_expressionset()`.

Fixed

- Inconsistent result of lncrnapred compared to original algorithm. Now
  is exactly the same.

- Documentation of internal functions is now hidden.

- `data-raw` missing in `.Rbuildignore`.

- `R CMD check` failing because of different lncRNApred results in
  factor indices. Fixed by converting unnecesary factors to chars.

- `R CMD check` failing because of `T` and `F` usage instead of
  `TRUE`/`FALSE`.

- `fantom_to_expset()` not always loading correctly; mouse and human
  had different metadata.

  twice)

- `data.frame` subsetting/ddply functions --> replaced with way faster
  data.table alternatives.

- A lot of refactoring in expression_prediction_function() and
  enrichment_analysis() to make it work with ExpressionSets.

- Documentation of lncRNApred related functions

[ideal](https://bioconductor.org/packages/ideal)
-----

                        Changes in version 1.8.0                        

New features

- plot_ma gains an additional parameter, labels_repel, for better
placing the labels on the features to mark - The pairwise correlation
plots can now use logarithmic scale in the axes, use smaller subsets
of the data for quicker inspection, and resizes the correlation info
proportionally to its intensity - The id types can now be chosen
among the keytypes of the corresponding annotation packages (which
still need to be installed when ideal is launched). Other input
fields that specify id types also behave in a similar manner (e.g. in
the Signature Explorer tab). This caused a problem for scenarios
where common id types such as ENSEMBL are not available, like in
Arabidopsis (where ids are provided often as TAIR) - thanks to Marc
Galland for picking this up in
https://github.com/federicomarini/ideal/issues/1 - The Signatures
Explorer tab also has a fully fledged tour for first-time users,
together with a collapsible help panel to describe its functionality
in brief - The zoomed MA-plot gains a new widget to control the
labels size for the names of the genes - It is possible to export the
input data together with the results in a combined
SummarizedExperiment object, which can be seamlessly fed into iSEE
(http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/iSEE.html). This
leverages a new function, wrapup_for_iSEE, which is available and
exported from ideal.

Other notes

- An information box has been added to provide detailed information
on the required input formats - Added notification to specify how to
install the airway package for demonstration purposes if not already
available - The Signatures Explorer tab is now displayed in a
conditional panel, i.e. only when the required inputs are provided

-------

                       Changes in version 1.12.1                        

- major update of INSPEcT, which now handles additional functions and
  analysis, such as: (i) extracting RNA dynamics from only total
  RNA-seq data, (ii) assessing differential regulation between steady
  states with an improved statistics, (iii) assessing the burden of the
  processing rate step in the responsiveness of mature RNA.

- minor updates regard the estimation of the variance from replicates,
  that now uses the package "DESeq2" (when read counts are available)
  or "plgem" (when only expression data is available) ######## the
  INSPEcT datasets older than this version are NOT COMPATIBLE anymore
  ############## ######## and must be updated using the function
  "convert_ids", available in the ############## ######## "inst" folder
  of the package. Usage: ############## >
  source(file.path(system.file(package='INSPEcT'), 'convert_ids.R')) >
  new_ids <- convert_ids(old_ids, degDuringPulse=c(FALSE,TRUE))

[IntEREst](https://bioconductor.org/packages/IntEREst)
--------

                        Changes in version 1.8.0                        

NEW FEATURES

- interest() and interest.sequential() functions support the
  possibility to define other parameter settings of BamFile() function
  of Rsamtools package e.g.  "qnamePrefixEnd" and "qnameSuffixStart".

- annotateU12() can return the PWM match scores (if requested). The
  hybrid AT-AG and GT-AC U12 types can be set to be ignored. The
  introns/exons coordinates can be filtered according to their map to
  another set of coordinates.

BUG FIXES

- referencePrepare() just gives warning and continue without annotating
  gene names (when annotateGeneIds=TRUE parameter is set) if annotating
  with gene names is not possible.

- interest() used to return Error if single end mapped reads did not
  existed at all (despite being requetsed). This has been corrected.

[IRanges](https://bioconductor.org/packages/IRanges)
-------

                       Changes in version 2.18.0                        

NEW FEATURES

- Add some methods for CharacterList derivatives (nchar, substring,
  substr, chartr, toupper, tolower, sub, gsub, grepl).

BUG FIXES

- Fix unlist() on a SimpleRleList object of length 0

- Fix drop() for FactorList derivatives

- Fix removed rownames upon replacing in a SplitDataFrameList

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

- Deprecate RangedData objects.  The use of RangedData objects has been
  discouraged in favor of GRanges or GRangesList objects since BioC
  2.12, that is, since 2014. Developers are required to migrate their
  code to use GRanges or GRangesList instead of RangedData objects (the
  GRanges and GRangesList classes are defined in the GenomicRanges
  package).

- Several RangedData methods are now defunct (after being deprecated in
  BioC 3.8): - score, score<-, lapply, within, countOverlaps; -
  coercions from list, data.frame, DataTable, Rle, RleList,
  RleViewsList, IntegerRanges, or IntegerRangesList to RangedData.

[limma](https://bioconductor.org/packages/limma)
-----

                       Changes in version 3.40.0                        

- Major rewrite of arrayWeights() to improve speed and stability. The
  arrayWeightsSimple() function has been removed and its functionality
  incorporated into arrayWeights(). A new 'var.group' argument has been
  added to simplify specification of the variance design matrix. The
  weights are now squeezed slightly towards unit and a new argument
  'prior.n' has been added to control the prior weight with which the
  array weights are squeezed. arrayWeights() now chooses between the
  REML and gene-by-gene algorithms automatically by default. REML is
  chosen when there are no prior weights or missing values and
  gene-by-gene is used otherwise. arrayWeights() now checks for and
  skips over any genes with zero residual variances.

- voom() now checks for experiments that have no replication. In this
  case it now returns weights that are all 1, with an informative
  warning but no error. Two references have been added to the voom help
  page.

- classifyTests.Rd now focuses on nested F-tests. The function FStat()
  is now removed. It was a convenience wrapper for classifyTestsF()
  with fstat.only=TRUE but is not used often enough to justify itself.
  classifyTestsP() is no longer exported as it is not intended to be
  called by users. The function classifyTestsT() is now removed, having
  been superceded by more sophisticated multiple testing methods.

- contrasts.fit() now removes any test statistics or p-values found in
  the fit object. This avoids any potential mis-match between
  coefficients and test statistics if eBayes() has been run on the
  object previously.
  
  More details have been added to the warning about approximations in
  the contrasts.fit() help page.

- The old function ebayes(), which was deprecated a year ago in favor
  of eBayes(), is now removed.

- The fitted() and residuals() methods for MArrayLM objects now give an
  informative error message if the object contains contrasts instead of
  the original coefficients.

- Rewrite Filtering chapter of User's Guide.

- Add Research Fields to the biocViews entry in the package DESCRIPTION
  file.

                       Changes in version 0.98.0                        

2018-12-13

See the issues within the "Bioconductor Submission" and "Vignette
Work" milestones for detailed descriptions of these changes, their
discussion, and motivation:
https://github.com/gabrielodom/pathwayPCA/issues

- Standardized naming conventions to UpperCamelCase for consistency -
Changed class name pathwaySet -> pathwayCollection - Added functions
SubsetPathwayData, getPathPCLs, LoadOntoPCs, write_gmt, getSampleIDs,
CheckSampleIDs, getTrimPathwayCollection, getPathwayCollection,
CheckPwyColl, CheckAssay, and print and subset methods for
pathwayCollection objects - Added sample ID requirements for input
assays and phenotype data.  Changed the phenotype required class from
anything to a data frame.  - Made the lars implementation a touch
more robust. If the algorithm fails to converge, then we default back
to regular SVD - The AESPCA function can also return pathway-specific
vanilla PCA.  Also, we inspected the parametric p-values compared to
the permutation-based p-values. They congruence is nearly perfect for
all of the data sets we tested. Thus, we changed the default p-value
estimation method for AESPCA to be parametric.  - Method functions
(*_pVals()) now return a list with the p-values data frame, list of
PC vectors (in a data frame), and list of loading vectors (in a data
frame). The getPathPCLs function will subset this list to return the
PCs, loadings, and administrivia of the method PCA output for a
single pathway - added the June homo sapiens pathway collection from
WikiPathways: wikipwsHS_Entrez_pathwayCollection - Lily wrote a
vignette geared to show off the diverse functionality of the package,
so this is the new main vignette. I broke off the plots from chapter
4 into their own chapter. The five vignettes I wrote are now
supplemental chapters - updated vignettes and website

                     Changes in version 0.0.0.9000                      

2018-03-20

- Added a NEWS.md file to track changes to the package.  - Built
website.

[pcaExplorer](https://bioconductor.org/packages/pcaExplorer)
-----------

                       Changes in version 2.10.0                        

New features

- Added extra parameters to topGOtable to offer more control on the
method used, and the option to correct the p-values for multiple
testing (via the Benjamini-Yekutieli procedure) - pca2go has now an
option to return (early) a list with vectors of genes with high
loadings - Better preview of the uploaded data with modal dialog
windows triggered by buttons which appear once corresponding inputs
are available - Improved notification system: in addition to the
progress bar, info that all input is correctly specified, or suggest
optional annotation loading - Added flexibility to select separator
for each of the uploadable files - The pairwise correlation plots can
now use logarithmic scale in the axes, use smaller subsets of the
data for quicker inspection, and resizes the correlation info
proportionally to its intensity - The sample to sample heatmap
supports additionally manhattan and correlation-based distances -
There is a new vignette with a detailed quick start, "Up and running
with pcaExplorer", specifying how the workflow with pcaExplorer can
look like, demonstrated on the airway dataset - In the Instructions
panel, we added buttons to access the fully rendered documentation,
either local or online if e.g. deployed to a server. Related to this,
pcaExplorer has a new parameter, runLocal, to control this behavior -
An additional parameter, annopkg, has been added to pca2go() to
override the behavior with the organism parameter (this is useful
when the name of the annotation package is not conform to the
classical org.Xx.eg.db, e.g. for Arabidopsis Thaliana); a detailed
use case has been added in the main vignette

Other notes

- The computing of the required objects now requires the explicit
action on the dedicated button, and the tooltip informs the user on
what steps are taken (including normalization) - An information box
has been added to provide detailed information on the required input
formats - Added notification to specify how to install the airway
package for demonstration purposes if not already available - Added
startup message upon loading the package - The content in the
Instructions tab is now contained in collapsible elements - The file
formats accepted by pcaExplorer are now specified both in the
vignette text, as well as in the app at runtime - The content of the
Instructions tab is now more compact, containing the rendered "Up and
running with pcaExplorer" vignette. The full vignettes can be
accessed via buttons in the same panel - Added instructions to
install phantomJS via the webshot package - would raise an error when
previewing the report

[pqsfinder](https://bioconductor.org/packages/pqsfinder)
---------

                         Changes in version 2.0                         

NEW FEATURES

- The qsfinder algorithm is ~100 times faster on real-world sequences
  than before. The main idea of the optimization is to stop the
  exhaustive search when we are sure there can't be found better PQS.
  The optimization is applied only in non-overlapping mode.

- New boolean argument called "deep". Once set to TRUE, pqsfinder will
  disable optimizations and run full exhaustive search.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- Default minimal PQS score was increased from 26 to 52. The score 52
  shows the best balanced accuracy on G4 sequencing data provided by
  Chambers et al. 2015.

BUG FIXES

- Fixed resolution of overlapping sequences. When multiple same-scoring
  PQS overlap, the shortest one is chosen.

[qPLEXanalyzer](https://bioconductor.org/packages/qPLEXanalyzer)
-------------

                        Changes in version 1.1.4                        

- Fixed bug in coveragePlot - github Issue 15: Previously the function
  cleaned the beginning of each peptide sequence by
  gsub("^\&#91;.\&#93;\.(&#91;A-Z&#93;+)\.\&#91;.\&#93;$", "\1", .).  However, it is not always
  the case that the terminal amino acids are surround by square
  brackets. I have put a more general regex in place that removes
  everything up to the first '.' and everything after the last '.'.

                        Changes in version 1.1.3                        

- 'ImmunoOncology' added to BiocViews.

  to Uniprot

                        Changes in version 1.1.1                        

- Fixed bug in maVolPlot - github Issue 12: Previously the
  'selectedGenes' argument used GeneSymbols to match genes to highlight
  in the plot. Not all accessions are annotated with a GeneSymbol, and
  some GeneSymbols are linked to more than one Accession. This could
  lead to situations where incorrect genes were being highlighted due
  to duplicate entries or NAs. The function now accepts and matches to
  accessions instead - this is now noted in the man pages.

- Fixed bug in convertToMSnset - github Issue 11: The function
  previously threw and error if the metadata was a tibble as it needs
  to set row names. The function now tranforms the metadata object to a
  data frame.

                        Changes in version 1.1.0

  3.7, but then this failed to pass in qsmooth version 0.99.3. So back
  to R version 3.6

                 Changes in version 0.99.3 (2019-03-29)                 

- Created a show method to show only first and last three values in the
  qsmoothWeights function and the head of the qsmoothData normalized
  matrix

- Updated all the examples and vignette to use the ExperimentHub
  bodymapRat data package

- Updated documentation in the plots.R file

- Included argument checking in the qsmooth.R file. Now checks if
  object is a matrix, data.frame or SummarizedExperiment.

------

                        Changes in version 1.15                         

- new legends in scatterplots.

  and disables the built in legend.

- custom genes in plots. See ExtractProjection() very useful, not yet
  in vignette - it calculates a projection among your custom gene set.

- Add lfcThreshold to the DESeq routines, so the p-values are adjusted
  correctly. ( implemented 1.15.1 ) This changes the behavior of most
  of the system. Expect a different gene set.

- New option to INIT() called renormalize, allowing user to specify
  preferred matrix normalization schema rather than the default
  DESeq2::varianceStabilizingTransform (when renormalize=FALSE).

- uses p.adjust(method='BH') on GOSeq's results to shorten the GO term
  list. use the 'padj' column.

- New option to DESeq , vst with blind=TRUE/FALSE at user discretion.

- Large improvements to performances when selecting subsets of datasets
  using the `index` argument.

- Resolved limitations where large datasets would exceed HDF5's 4GB
  maximum chunk size.  The default options will now check if this will
  occur and adjust chunking automatically.

- Single-rank datasets larger than 2^31-1 entries can now be read into
  R vectors.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

- Include various additional files from Samtools 1.7: bam_aux.c,
  bam_endian.h, and bam_cat.c

- Add C function faidx_fetch_seq_forced_lower() to the HTSlib code.
  This is an alternative to HTSlib C function faidx_fetch_seq(), with
  the following difference: if coordinates are outside the actual
  sequence, write N's, rather than adjusting the start,end. Used in the
  seqbias package (and originally written by seqbias' author and
  maintainer, Daniel Jones).

BUG FIXES

- Fix long-standing kvsprintf() bug on Windows. This low-level bug was
  responsible for breaking "scan_bcf_header" .Call entry point in
  Rsamtools, which in turn was responsible for the infamous 'invalid
  class "VCFHeader" object' bug in VariantAnnotation::readVcf().

- Fix for Solaris: Do not build standalone executables (e.g. bgzip,
  tabix, etc...). They're not needed and seem to cause problems on

[universalmotif](https://bioconductor.org/packages/universalmotif)
--------------

                        Changes in version 1.2.0                        

NEW FEATURES

- New motif_peaks() function: test for significantly overrepresented
  peaks of motif sites in a set of sequences.

- New get_bkg() function: calculate background frequencies of sequence
  alphabets, including higher order backgrounds. Works for any sequence
  alphabet. Can also create MEME background format files.

- read_meme() has a new option, readites.meta, which allows for reading
  individual motif site positions and P-values, as well as combined
  sequence P-values.

- shuffle_sequences(..., method = "markov") works for any set of
  characters instead of just DNA/RNA.

- shuffle_sequences(): new shuffling method, 'euler'. This allows for
  k>1 shuffling that preserves exact letter counts, as opposed to
  'markov'. This method is set as the new default shuffling method.

- create_sequences() has a new option "freqs" which allows for
  generating sequence from higher order backgrounds and any sequence
  alphabet (options "monofreqs", "difreqs" and "trifreqs" are now
  deprecated).

- universalmotif objects can now hold onto higher order backgrounds.

- motif_pvalue() with use.freq > 1 can calculate P-values from provided
  higher-order backgrounds, instead of assuming a uniform background.

- add_multifreq() adds corresponding higher order background
  probabilities to motifs.

- New get_klets() utility function: generate all possible k-lets for
  any set of characters.

- New score_match() utility function: score a match for a particular
  motif.

- New get_matches() utility function: get all possible motif matches
  above a certain score.

- New count_klets() utility function: count all k-lets for any string
  of characters.

- New motif_score() utility function: calculate motif score from input
  thresholds.

- New shuffle_string() utility function: shuffle a string of character
  using one of three methods: euler, linear, and markov.

- The native write_motifs()/read_motifs() universalmotif format is now
  YAML based. Motifs written before v1.2.0 can still be read by
  read_motifs().

MINOR CHANGES

- Increased input security for character type parameters throughout.

- Expanded motif_pvalue(), scan_sequences(), motif_tree() examples
  sections.

- New vignette sections for motif_peaks() and get_bkg() added to
  SequenceSearches.Rmd.

- Various vignette tweaks.

- Fixed various spelling mistakes throughout, added Language field to
  Description, and added spell check to tests.

- Documentation for the "random" shuffling method has been removed and
  a warning is shown when used to tell the user that it will be removed
  in the next minor update.

- Generally increased test coverage.

- The "k=1", "linear" and "markov" shuffling methods are much faster.

- create_sequences() for higher order backgrounds is much faster.

- Faster add_multifreqs(): slight improvement for DNA motifs, big
  improvement for non-DNA motifs.

- sample_sites() has been rewritten for use.freq > 1: the probability
  of each letter in the site is now dependent on the previous letters
  (also faster and more memory efficient for any use.freq).

- Improvement to calculating motif scores from p-value input: no longer
  guesses different scores, instead estimating a normal distribution of
  scores. This new approach is much, much faster and more memory
  efficient. It does however assume a uniform background.

- The "score.pct" column in scan_sequences() results now represents the
  percent score based on the total possible score, not just the score
  between zero and the max possible score.

- summarise_motifs() is much faster.

- Objects in data/ are saved using serialization format version 3.

- convert_motifs(motif, class = "universalmotif-universalmotif"):
  performs a validObject() check if "motif" is a universalmotif object.

- The show() method for universalmotif objects performs a validObject()
  check first.

- motif_rc() has a new option "ignore.alphabet", used to turn on or off
  the alphabet check (checks for DNA/RNA motif).

- Added "overwrite" and "append" options to write_*() functions.

- enrich_motifs(..., return.scan.results = FALSE): uses a slimmed down
  version of scan_sequences() which skips construction of the complete
  results data.frame, saving a tiny bit of time on large jobs.

- compare_motifs() now includes log P-values. This way comparisons can
  still be properly ranked even if their P-values are below the machine
  limit.

- convert_motifs() from MotifList (MotifDb) carries over dataSource.

- If a MEME motif has two names, the second will be assigned as
  "altname" by read_meme().

- Utilities documentation has been split into two: ?utils-motif and
  ?utils-sequence.

BUG FIXES

- Fixed IC score calculation from character input in create_motif().

- The internal DNA consensus letter calculation previously did not
  assign ambiguous letters when one PPM position was >0.5 and another
  was >0.25. This was unintended behaviour and will now output the
  proper ambigous DNA letter.

- ch2locs (retrievable via dsQTL::getSNPlocs) has been changed at about
  1850 locations where rs numbers had been associated with hg19
  addresses; the dsQTL regions are hg18 as are all the chr2... SNP
  addresses.  Previously the discoverable rs numbers used in the
  Chicago distribution from
  http://eqtl.uchicago.edu/dsQTL_data/GENOTYPES/ had be mapped via
  SNPlocs...20111119, but now they come directly from the Chicago text
  file.
