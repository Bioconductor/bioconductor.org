Web Site Updates
================

The Bioconductor web site underwent significant changes during the last
release cycle. The web site includes extensive help resources for both
users and package developers, in addition to information on package
installation. One particularly useful feature in navigating the large
numbers of available packages is the updated biocViews widget
