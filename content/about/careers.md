<h2 id="SAPII" />SYSTEMS ANALYST PROGRAMMER  II</h2>

This opportunity is also
[posted online](https://careers-fhcrc.icims.com/jobs/2964/systems-analyst-programmer-ii%2c-bioconductor/job).

The [Bioconductor](/) project seeks a creative
and motivated individual to join our bioinformatics team. Bioconductor
develops and distributes open-source, open-development software for
analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data from
sequencing and other sources. Bioconductor is based on the R language
for statistical analysis, with more than 670 software packages
developed internally and by our vibrant user community.

SCOPE OF RESPONSIBILITIES

This unique opportunity emphasizes scientific computing software
development. The successful candidate will work under immediate
technical direction. The successful candidate will develop and
maintain algorithms and data representations for use by our vibrant
user community. The successful candidate will become familiar with the
bioinformatic needs of our users. The successful candidate will have
responsibility for implementing software packages in specific domains
of application, and will share responsibility with other team members
for routine maintenance of our large base of existing and
user-contributed packages.

MAJOR DUTIES

This position involves software development, primarily related to
annotation and analysis of high-throughput sequence data using R /
Bioconductor tools. The successful candidate will write robust R code
for efficiently organizing and processing large volumes of sequence
and annotation data. The successful candidate will have responsibility
for implementing cloud-based data management solutions that integrate
with the R environment. The successful candidate will participate in
our Agile-like development process. The successful candidate will also
participate in Bioconductor activities involved with user interaction:
technical support contact through our mailing list; evaluation of new
user-contributed packages; and training courses / annual conferences.

MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS

1. Bachelor’s degree with one year of experience in biostatistics,
   computer science, bioinformatics, or related disciplines.
2. Familiarity with programming languages, especially C and R.
3. High-level familiarity with modern web services implementations.
4. Familiarity with statistical concepts and methods.
5. Experience with software development best practices, for instance
   use of version control, unit tests, agile project management, and
   creation of end-user documentation.

Recommended qualifications include:

1. Ability to implement reusable, user-directed software.
2. Familiarity with managing high-volume genetic data, such as from
   next-generation sequence pipelines, and with relevant public
   annotation resources.
3. Familiarity with and enthusiasm for diverse programming languages
   and paradigms.
4. Enthusiasm for molecular biological processes.
5. Familiarity with bioinformatic work flows.
