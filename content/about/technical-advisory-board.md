# ![](/images/icons/magnifier.gif)Technical Advisory Board

The Technical Advisory Board purpose is to support the _Bioconductor_
mission by

- Developing strategies to ensure long-term technical suitability of
  core infrastructure for the _Bioconductor_ mission. Core
  infrastructure includes: all aspects of package addition,
  management, and distribution; end-user engagement (e.g., web,
  support site, and slack); developer support; and development of
  packages for use by the broader developer community.

- Identifying and pursuing technical and scientific aspects of funding
  strategies for long-term viability of _Bioconductor_.
