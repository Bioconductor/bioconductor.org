# ![](/images/icons/magnifier.gif) Package Reviewers

This page is in recognition to members of the community who have volunteered to
assist with the review of newly submitted packages to Bioconductor. Anyone from
the community may volunteer. More detailed information on [Expectations of Reviewers][].

We also encourage communication and conversation on any package review from the
community in addition to assigned reviewers: [Packages Under Review][]. All
package reviews are publicly accessible, therefore any feedback and interactions on
submitted packages must abide by the Bioconductor [Code of Conduct][].
