# Bioconductor Community Awards

The Bioconductor project proudly launched in 2020 an initiative to honor
contributions to the project. Each year, four awardees will be selected, each
having contributed to the project in an outstanding way based on one or more of
the criteria listed below. The awardees will be recognized during a ceremony at
the annual Bioconductor conference, as well as on the Bioconductor website.

# Award criteria

The awardees will be selected among the nominees based on the following
criteria. It is possible, but not required, for multiple criteria to contribute
towards the selection of an awardee. Up to four awardees are selected in each
call using the below criteria as justification. One award each year is dedicated
to a junior developer or new package development.

- **Outstanding new package contributions**, for developers of high-quality packages, added to Bioconductor in one of the two most recent releases prior to the nomination deadline, showing exemplary use of the Bioconductor package design principles.
- **Outstanding support site contributions**, for individuals showing extraordinary helpfulness on the Bioconductor support site and/or in other forums.
- **Outstanding documentation contributions**, for individuals writing and maintaining excellent user-facing documentation, workflows and/or tutorials.
- **Outstanding community engagement and outreach**, for individuals who "make things happen", promote diversity, engage with and provide substantial contributions to the Bioconductor community.
- **Outstanding long-term contributions to the project**, for individuals who have provided excellent contributions in any form to the project over a substantial time period.
- **Outstanding contributions enabling computational analysis or representation of data from new scientific technologies**, for individuals who, via package development or other means, enable analysis of data from new scientific technologies within Bioconductor.
- **Outstanding contributions enabling the use of new informatic technologies within the project**, for individuals who, via package development or other means, enable the use of novel informatic technologies within Bioconductor.

All nominees suggested will be considered for the award. The nominations will be
processed, and the awardees will be selected, by the current members of the
Bioconductor Community Advisory Board and Technical Advisory Board. Currently
active members of either of these boards are not eligible for an award. For more
details about the selection process see the [Procedures and
Regulations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bHFoZS7kJoUh9ZOU2LwZaHwnJhradDmWcDV9EXJc8tI/edit?usp=sharing)
