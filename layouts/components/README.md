# Components folder

The purpose of the components folder is to store stand-alone components
that can be included in pages, rather than full layouts. This folder serves
as a centralized location for organizing and managing the components.

## Folder Structure

The components folder is organized in a hierarchical structure that
facilitates efficient file management. Within this folder, each component
is stored as an individual file.

## Reference Update in HTML file

To ensure proper referencing of files within the HTML files, follow the
steps below when creating and integrating components into the project:

1. Create a new component file:

- When creating a new component, save it as an individual file within
  the components folder.

2. Include the component in HTML files:

- In the HTML files where you want to use the component, add the
  necessary code to include the component file. Remember to include the
  necessary path /components/<file_name>.

3. Test the HTML files:

- Perform thorough testing to ensure that the HTML files function as intended
  with the newly added components. Check that all components are displayed
  correctly and that there are no broken links or missing resources.
